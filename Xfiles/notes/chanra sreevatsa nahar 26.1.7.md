## Framing: 3 write Papers

- ### End Goal (What we want)

- ### Middle Ground (Practical / doable)    

- ### Start (First step)

---

## Strategic Notes

- **Do not present the whole plan at once** (avoid red flags)
    
- Create an **incentive city** for owners of condemned / degraded land:
    
    - Land → regeneration → micro-forests → carbon credits → shared value
        

---

## Land / Ecology

### Types of “Mines”

1. **Escaped / surface**
    
    - Usable without any work
        
2. **Granite**
    
    - Only good for water storage
        
3. **Deep (~30 ft, limestone)**
    
    - Not buildable traditionally
        
    - Ecologically valuable easy for trees to grow 
    - ideal for us
        
### Land in Trust

- Land transferred into a **trust**
    
- Landowners receive **carbon credits**
    
- Companies **cannot own the land** that we regenerate 
    

---

## Constraints

- **Climate**
    
    - +3°C scenario
        
    - Root temp >40°C → tree death
        
- **Political / Legal**
    
    - Government support required
        
    - Secure land title / trust structure
        
- **Ecological**
    
    - Forest protection comes first
        

---

## Structure: 3 Entities

1. **Forest (Nonprofit)**
    
    - Owns / regenerates forest
        
    - Holds and distributes carbon credits
        
2. **Governance**
    
    - find a solution to the human problem
        
    - Rules, transparency, long-term stewardship
        
3. **Construction / City (For-profit)**
    
    - Builds city under ecological + governance constraints
        

---

## Regenerative Land Model

- Site size: **500–5,000 acres**
    
- Carbon credits:
    
    - Land exchanged for credits
        
    - Example: give 20% → receive value back via credits
        
- State protection required
    
- Legal structure to prevent land commodification
    

---

## Step 1 — Forest & Land

**Do**

- Find forests
    
- Identify degraded forests / mine land
    
- Create reforestation plans
    
- Build **resource maps**
    
- Calculate **regeneration cost**
    

**Output**

- Forest + degradation map
    
- Cost per acre
    
- Land-trust legal framework
    

---

## Step 2 — City

**Based on what we know**

- Where forests are
    
- Where mines are
    
- Where degraded land exists
    

**Questions**

- Where can a city be built?
    
- What does a regenerative city look like?
    
- How do we stay carbon-negative?
    

---

## Funding

- Re-greening / regeneration programs
    
- Carbon credits
    
- Sovereign / wealth funds (target: **March outreach**)
    

---

## People

### Sreevatsa

**Meeting agenda**

- Why new cities are needed
    
- Our access to land
    
- How to raise funding
    
- How wealth is generated
    
- How such a system is supported
    
- What we may be missing
    
- Auroville context → ask to collaborate
    
- Follow-up: **24 Jan**
    

**Tasks**

- Find potential land for city
    
- Forest proposal:
    
    - Govt degraded forests
        
    - Areas planned for cities
        
    - Hill / forest regions
        
- Generate maps:
    
    - Forests
        
    - Forests that could host cities
        

---

### Chandra

- Find funding
    
- Estimate required capital
    
### Nahar

- write the 3 papers

## Open Problems

1. **Land security**
    
    - Titles, trusts, protection
        
2. **Incentives**
    
    - Why landowners give land
        
    - How carbon value is returned
        

---

## Immediate To-Do

- Talk to forestry experts: _how do we rewire existing systems?_
    
- Identify people in power who can support this
    
- Ask government:
    
    - Will they support?
        
    - Where are they planning new cities?
        
- Draft legal structure:
    
    - Land trust
        
    - Carbon credit ownership
        
    - Nonprofit / for-profit separation
