## preface

for me one of the great things about email is that it lets us take the required amount of time to contemplate and answer the very difficult and novel questions that we are discussing and it helps us create a data corpus that we can later feed into an llm structure and use to start writing the required documents 
# questions

#### how do you envision the Oslo project operating?
to me it sounded like you where thinking of taking funds and using them to scale other project almost like a VC fund for development projects

you mentioned 10 villages to form a network i am not quite sure what you meant by this.
I want to understand better. 

## how do i see the machine & AI human future 

one of the issues with helping a population move up economically is you end up increasing their consumption.
one story from my last company where we took cleaning ladies and trained and gave them jobs in a commercial kitchen for a higher pay is that one of the first thing that they did was buy bikes with a loan with a 25%+ interest rate from the village lone shark. 
even if we don't give money directly once they increase their purchasing power they will join the shit show. this is one of the reasons that i am quite skeptic about the value of helping populations develop extraction systems or constructing infrastructure without governance and deep systemic changes.
this to me is why i think that LLMs provide us with an opportunity to both develop and guide a population at the same time if we don't guide the population and direct them the cities, local film industry american social media and the  will be their teachers

## what do i care about and why  

the thing that i care about the most in this project and is the idea that i have spent the last 6 years exploring is how to structure organisations to increase their performance. we need to design a more efficient collaborative system that creates a world that is both out of the shitshow and yet provides a higher quality of life for its participents.
this is a project that is personal for me firstly due to watching auroville fall ive seen small glimpses of such systems working in auroville but not for long this is what i feel can be my greatest contribution to this world and its some

## Oslo Interactions with Governments

Governments are finicky entities. They  mostly have the power to say no and the thing that they are the most concerned with is looking good to their constituents and superiors. 
we need to approach governments as an easy project to support that can make them look very good to their superiors if we succeed and prove to them that we will not make them look bad or create stress with their constituents.

## where do we build and why 

this depends greatly on what project we are envisioning if its a research site for collaboration or a site where we are testing out alternative systems with people that we are bringing in then it must be in a place with no local population we cannot hope to integrate people this will lead to stress and conflict.
if we are building a project where we are trying to develop a local population with grass roots action then selecting a place where we have a government thats easily controllable and good willed is very important we will meet a lot of governments that will suck up to us to get money and work but will turn on us later. selecting villages that are small with a proactive young population with a lot of motivation and goodwill will be the difference between success and a painful fallout. we must ensure that any project that we pick up and invest into we retain sufficient leverage with the administrative body and a lot of goodwill with the youth.
