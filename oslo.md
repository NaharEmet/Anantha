## AI-Enabled Context and review

Every participant is paired with an **AI agent** that:

- provides historical and situational context  
    
- surfaces relevant precedents  
    
- discusses options and consequences  
    
- flags inconsistencies  
    
- proposes actions and repairs  
    

Humans give input and **approve or reject** .

They do **not design governance manually**.

No decision proceeds without AI-generated context.
