One of the things I value about email is that it gives us the time and space to think carefully about questions that are complex layered and new. It also leaves behind a written trail that we can later structure and refine and even feed into an LLM to extract information from.

### How do you envision the Oslo project operating?

From our conversation, it sounded to me as if  you sow the Oslo project operating somewhat like a green development fund, where capital is deployed into several successful projects to scale them.

You also mentioned the idea of 10 villages forming a network. I’m not entirely clear on how you’re imagining this in practice, whether these are parallel experiments, sequential phases, or a more tightly coordinated system.

### What I care about most, and why

The thing I care about most in this project is something I’ve been exploring for the last six years: **how do we structure and build collaborative non hierarchical organizations **.

I’m increasingly convinced that this is the first real lever for addressing the global crises. I’ve seen brief glimpses of such systems working in Auroville, but never for long, and never with the capacity to scale without collapsing or being captured.

what interests me is discovering organizational forms that can survive contact with reality.


### AI–human future

One of the core challenges with helping a population move up economically is that it increases consumption.

In my last company, we took cleaning staff and trained them for higher-paid jobs in a commercial kitchen. One of the first things several of them did was buy motorbikes using loans at 25%+ interest from local loan sharks. Even without direct cash transfers, increased purchasing power pulls people into the shit show.

This is why I’m skeptical of development efforts that focus on income, infrastructure, or extraction capacity without governance and deep systemic change. Without guidance, people don’t exit the system, they get absorbed more deeply into it.

This is where I think LLMs offer a new approach: the possibility to _develop and guide at the same time_. If we don’t consciously; guide learning, adjust values, and shape decision-making at the both the individual and collective level, then nearby cities, local film industries, and American social media will do it for us.

On a more meta level, i think we’re moving toward an unemployment crisis. The whole system is built around extracting human labor, and that assumption is starting to break. A future where a small minority is employed at very high salaries while the rest of society survives on food stamps is almost guaranteed to create social unrest.

One interesting angle for us might be to focus on a post-scarcity world and start building systems designed for it. Most competent governments can probably see the employment shock coming, and early trials already suggest that UBI on its own isn’t functional without secondary support systems around it. we could offer a low risk way for them to start preparing for this future.

### Oslo interactions with governments

the most important job of middle management is covering their ass. Governments are made up almost entirely of middle management.

most people in government have the power to say no and not much else, and their primary concern is looking good to constituents and superiors while avoiding risk.

We need to approach governments, offering them an _easy win_: a project that is safe to support, makes them look good if it succeeds, and doesn’t create stress or backlash if it doesn’t. Demonstrating that we won’t embarrass them or destabilize their local context is essential.

### Where we build, and why

This depends heavily on what kind of project we’re talking about.

If the site is primarily a research or experimental collaboration space — where we’re testing alternative systems with people we bring in — then it should be in a place with no local population. Integration adds unavoidable tension and conflict that will derail early-stage experimentation.

If the goal is grassroots development with an existing population, then site selection becomes critical. We need:

- Small villages
    
- A proactive and motivated youth population
    
- Demonstrated goodwill
    
- A government that is not just friendly, but predictable and influenceable
    

We will encounter many governments that are welcoming early on and turn hostile later. The difference between success and a painful fallout will be whether we retain sufficient leverage with the administrative body and deep goodwill with the local youth and a majority of the population.

Without both, the risks compound quickly.
