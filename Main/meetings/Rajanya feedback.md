1. Concept note & website: strong intent, but too long for what it is    
At its core, both the concept note and the website are doing the same job — articulating the idea and philosophy. The concept note, in particular, could be tightened into a sharp one-pager with better space management. Right now, it reads more like a manifesto than a pitchable or decision-ready document.  


2. The “why” needs sharper India-specific grounding    
The “why” is present but feels broad and generic. It would benefit a lot from deeper contextualisation to India — why this experiment is necessary here, now, and what specifically about India’s urbanisation, governance constraints, climate risks, or labour markets makes Anantha relevant. Harder framing and some India-specific data would significantly strengthen the case.  
  
3. Philosophy-heavy, but not yet outcome-driven    
There is a lot of thoughtful philosophy, but very little articulation of clearly defined outcomes or KPIs. If this is a testable experiment, it needs a scorecard.    
This includes:  
- Human-level metrics: well-being, time-use, creative output, collaboration, etc. (even if measured via surveys or proxies)    
- System-level metrics: energy use, biodiversity impact, local employment, food sovereignty, governance efficiency    
  
Right now, “wealth” is defined conceptually, but not operationally.  
  
4. Missing a tangible picture of the city itself    
Neither the site nor the note gives a concrete sense of what the city actually looks like. There’s no clear articulation of scale, spatial design, density, radius, zoning, or how 10,000 people would actually live, work, and interact day-to-day. Even a high-level masterplan or conceptual visual would help translate philosophy into something real.  
  
5. Stakeholder value propositions are unclear    
At the moment, it’s not obvious what different stakeholders tangibly gain:  
- For residents / creative people:    
  What do they get here that they don’t already get in places like Auroville or other creative ecosystems? What is the step-change?  
- For investors:    
  Beyond backing a unique and intellectually interesting pilot, what is the upside? Learning, IP, replicability, economic returns — this needs to be clearer.  
- For government / state:    
  Since land and policy are unavoidable, what does the state concretely gain? Jobs, livelihoods, secondary economic activity, tax revenues, regional development — these outcomes need to be explicitly articulated.  
  
6. No clear economic, legal, or delivery pathway yet    
The site speaks about governance structures and technology (AI agents, ledgers), but doesn’t yet address implementation realities — funding pathways, rough capex/opex thinking, land acquisition or leasing models, jurisdictional setup, or data/privacy safeguards. Without this scaffolding, the idea feels aspirational rather than build-ready.  
  
7. Replicability needs to be framed as an outcome, not an assumption    
Right now, Anantha clearly reads as a social experiment — but only an experiment. What are the outcomes that make it replicable? What can scale, be copied, or inform future urban or governance models in India?  
  
Overall, I think the ambition and systems thinking behind Anantha are genuinely strong. The next iteration, though, needs to move decisively from philosophy to clarity - clearer visuals, clearer metrics, clearer stakeholder value, and a clearer path from idea to pilot. That shift will make it much easier for people to engage with this seriously. 

  

I'm sure there's definitely thinking on this, but it's just not being reflected yet in the concepts so far.   
  
Happy to discuss any of this or help think through next steps sometime this week or the next.
