# 1. Governance Function Metrics

These measure whether coordination is improving.

## 1.1 Information Asymmetry

**Problem:** Decisions are made without the people who hold relevant knowledge.

**Measured by:**

- % of decisions including verified frontline input
    
- % including relevant SMEs
    
- Decision knowledge coverage score  
    _(diversity of perspectives represented)_
    

---

## 1.2 Coordination Friction

**Problem:** Decisions take too long, so reality shifts before action occurs.

**Measured by:**

- Median time from problem identification → decision
    
- Median time from decision → implementation start
    
- Total coordination latency per decision
    

---

## 1.3 Representation Loss

**Problem:** Governance optimizes for optics rather than outcomes.

**Measured by:**

- Participation rate (direct or agent-mediated)
    
- Correlation between aggregated member sentiment and final decisions
    
- Member “voice heard” score from surveys
    

---

## 1.4 Execution Gap

**Problem:** Decisions fail during implementation.

**Measured by:**

- Implementation completion rate
    
- Cost variance vs approved plan
    
- Outcome alignment score  
    _(actual result vs intended goal)_
    

---

## 1.5 Conflict Compounding

**Problem:** Small misunderstandings escalate into systemic instability.

**Measured by:**

- % of conflicts resolved at clarification stage
    
- Escalation rate per conflict
    
- Average conflict resolution time
    
- Recurrence rate of similar disputes
    

---

## 1.6 Values Drift

**Problem:** Communities lose coherence as rules accumulate without grounding in shared principles.

**Measured by:**

- % of decisions mapped to stated values
    
- Frequency of values-dissonance alerts
    
- Value consistency score across decisions over time
    

---

# 2. Human Outcome Metrics

These measure whether governance improves people’s lived experience.

## 2.1 Individual Well-Being

Tracked via agent check-ins and behavioral signals.

Measured by:

- Life satisfaction trends
    
- Stress / overwhelm indicators
    
- Sense of agency (“I feel heard”)
    
- Trust in governance
    
- Social connectedness
    

**Output:**  
Individual Well-Being Index (time series per member)

---

## 2.2 Collective Well-Being

Measured by:

- Inequality of satisfaction (variance across members)
    
- Conflict frequency trends
    
- Volunteer participation rates
    
- Retention / migration signals
    
- Community trust score
    

**Output:**  
Community Health Score

This prevents optimizing averages while harming minorities.

# 3. Future Trajectory Metrics

These track whether decisions improve long-term resilience and capability.

## 3.1 Decision Impact Tracking

Each decision is evaluated across time horizons.

### Short-Term (0–3 months)

- Did it achieve its stated goal?
    
- Did unintended friction appear?
    
- Was implementation smooth?
    

### Medium-Term (3–12 months)

- Did it reduce recurring problems?
    
- Did it increase capacity or resilience?
    
- Did it create autonomy or dependency?
    

### Long-Term (1–5 years, rolling)

- Did it expand optionality?
    
- Did it increase collective competence?
    
- Did it reduce future decision burden?
    

**Output:**  
Forward Momentum Score per decision

---

## 3.2 Resource Intelligence

Tracks whether coordination reduces waste and unlocks abundance.

Measured by:

- Resource utilization rate
    
- Waste trends
    
- Redundant work detected
    
- Coordination time vs execution time
    
- Production vs satisfaction ratio
    

**Output:**  
Resource Intelligence Index

# 4. What Success Looks Like

| **Dimension**         | **Failure**           | **Success**                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Decision Speed        | Months                | Days or weeks                 |
| Participation         | <20% engaged          | >80% represented              |
| Knowledge Inclusion   | Partial / opaque      | Frontline + SME input visible |
| Value Coherence       | Implicit / drifting   | Explicit and tracked          |
| Representation        | Optics-driven         | Sentiment-aligned decisions   |
| Execution             | Stalled / diluted     | Delivered on spec             |
| Conflict Handling     | Escalates late        | Resolved early                |
| Individual Well-Being | Not measured          | Stable or improving trend     |
| Collective Well-Being | Invisible             | Visible and improving         |
| Future Trajectory     | Reactive              | Forward momentum increasing   |
| Resource Efficiency   | Waste and duplication | Utilization improving         |

# 5. North Star Metrics

To make system health legible at a glance, Anantha OS aggregates all signals into three composite indicators.

---

## 5.1 Governance Responsiveness Index

**Captures:**  
How effectively the system converts reality into action.

**Combines:**

- Decision speed
    
- Knowledge inclusion
    
- Participation rate
    
- Execution completion
    

**Meaning:**  
A rising score means the community can sense, decide, and act quickly without losing accuracy.

---

## 5.2 Community Health Index

**Captures:**  
Whether governance improves people’s lived experience.

**Combines:**

- Individual well-being trends
    
- Collective satisfaction distribution
    
- Conflict frequency and resolution speed
    
- Trust and agency signals
    

**Meaning:**  
A rising score means people feel better, more stable, and more represented.

---

## 5.3 Forward Momentum Index

**Captures:**  
Whether decisions are improving the future.

**Combines:**

- Long-term decision outcomes
    
- Reduction in recurring problems
    
- Capability and autonomy growth
    
- Resource efficiency gains
    
- Resilience and optionality expansion
    

**Meaning:**  
A rising score means the system compounds intelligence and capacity over time.

# Core Principle

If governance is working:

- Decisions are fast and informed
    
- people feel heard and stable
    
- resources are used intelligently
    
- Society is in a sense of flow
    

**Anantha OS measures all four simultaneously.**
