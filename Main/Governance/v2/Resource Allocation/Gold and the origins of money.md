Its kind of funny to think that before the 80s when Currency became backed by energy with the petro dollar it was backed by sex. The origins of the value of gold are from jewlery and as a symbol of prestige both assets used to purchase sex and social standing. 
the issue today is that women have forgotten that this is a power that they wield and they have bought into the world of materialism where sex is meaningless. just as a thought experiment it is self evident that if all women signed an agreement to only slept with people that held a set of values within 50 years all of the people would only have these values. now this is ofcorse impossible and yet it presents an interesting fact. that in the end with all of the gymansitics we do to keep the global economy aflote all fiat Currency in the end of the day exists to allocate sex and to borrow a term from the incels dictate (SMV) sexual market value.

to replace Currency with a different resource allocation mechanism the first question that we must answer is how do we allocate prestige, social standing and with it sex.
any resource allocation system that does not underwrite itself with sex will leave an opening to the old worlds sexual allocation mechanism and with it fiat currency. 
this presents an interesting opportunity. we know that matriarchal societies tend to stagnate. crudely put this is due to men not being rewarded for innovation and conflict as matriarchal societies being more care focused.
the answer to a either or question is why not both? we want a nurturing society with a faster pace of innovation where men are inscentivized to innovate and take risks and where women are the moral compass that drive the society towards its best shape.

any new Currency or system we would want to create it must be backed by the 2 most fundemental drives of man.
