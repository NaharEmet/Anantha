### complex adaptive system
function first -> system 
structure is scaffolding but not the building 


cities are plants where do they draw material and energy from 
cities that needs to pull ressorcess from afar consume a lot of energy 


#### KW for well being 
### key KPI: KW per unit of well being

bottom up system that evolves through biology 
cities adapted to their environment 
###### blue green infra is the base 
#### Key kpi: Energy efficiency

Red queen problem 


# energy!!!

##### energy 
##### resilientliant 
##### small 
##### efficient 


### what does blue green infra effect energy consumption?

## energy: efficiency over generation

cooling commons not personal 
### how to win the blue green infrastructure argument?




##### tension is life balance is death 


#### make the statistics tangible! 



circular 
adaptable 
resilient 

20k people ideal number 

## Core problems
energy efficient
water efficient
building materials



## water
how to get?
water is a product a commodity a service and faith 
#### water security 
collection 
sewage recycling 
storm water management
	part of blue green infrastructure
capture water in soil 
more than just water 

bigger cities need more water
measured as just human centric
water needs to be designed with local context

### building materials 
nothing is better than concrete
mimic corral reeffes
	lime 
how widly is lime available

# building materials 
### Need a paper on lime stone 
_why was lime not used_
### cement lobby 


look at dhune next to jaipur 


### Government classification 
more than 5l corpration 
more than 50k municipalities
10 to 50k town panchayat 

pollution in water is propitiation to corruption 


preferred solution: collection of small towns

# Articulate: vision of the ideal world 
#### written 
#### Envisioned 
universal framework
+ 2 to 3 local solutions


every city that survived for a 1000 years had a belief 
	what is our belief 


#### Read up on complex adaptive systems 



same global frame work solution local context 


Agriculture and food abundance
	anshul and auro orchard
	seeds and resilinace
	food forests
