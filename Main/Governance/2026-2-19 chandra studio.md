### complex adaptive system
function first -> system 
structure is scaffolding but not the building 


cities are plants where do they draw material and energy from 
cities that needs to pull ressorcess from afar consume a lot of energy 


#### KW for well being 
### key KPI: KW per unit of well being

bottom up system that evolves through biology 
cities adapted to their environment 
###### blue green infra is the base 
#### Key kpi: Energy efficiency

Red queen problem 


# energy!!!

##### energy 
##### resilientliant 
##### small 
##### efficient 


### what does blue green infra effect energy consumption?

## energy: efficiency over generation

cooling commons not personal 
### how to win the blue green infrastructure argument?




##### tension is life balance is death 


#### make the statistics tangible! 



circular 
adaptable 
resilient 
energy efficient
water efficient



## water
how to get?
water is a product a commodity a service and faith 
#### water security 
collection 
sewage recycling 
storm water management
	part of blue green infrastructure
capture water in soil 
more than just water 

bigger cities need more water
measured as just human centric
water needs to be designed with local context

### building materials 
nothing is better than concrete
mimic corral reeffes
	lime
