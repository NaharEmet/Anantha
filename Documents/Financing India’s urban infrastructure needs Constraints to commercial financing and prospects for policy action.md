Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                              7
Executive Summary
India is rapidly urbanizing, and the financing needs of cities are expanding proportionately. A sustained
increase in urban infrastructure investment is needed to enable economic growth, improve quality of
living and livability, and build resilience to the expected impacts of climate change. However, cities face
significant challenges. Despite a substantial increase in fiscal transfers to cities in the last decade, there
is a large shortfall of resources relative to needs. Government of India (GoI) has previously estimated the
urban infrastructure financing deficit to be 80% of needs1 and has underscored the potential for financing
from private sources to bridge this gap, including through municipal borrowing and public-private
partnerships (PPPs). GoI and several states have taken measures to enable commercial financing, but its
use remains extremely limited even in financially strong cities. Systemic constraints seem to constrain
larger volumes of private financing from flowing to the urban sector.

This report aims to identify these key constraints and provide policy proposals for GoI, states and
cities to address them. It presents updated estimates of infrastructure investment needs and analyses
recent trends in capital investment and commercial financing for urban infrastructure. The scope of
private financing considered here includes two primary sources: municipal borrowing/debt financing and
municipal PPPs.


Conceptual framework and its relevance to India’s urban finance system
There are six key factors that impact the demand for, and supply of, private commercial financing for urban
infrastructure which collectively determine the flow, size, and scope of this financing (see Figure 1).

The existing relationship between state governments and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/city agencies
underpins and influences all aspects of infrastructure financing. State governments have the primary
responsibility to regulate the mandates, scope, and financial activities of all ULBs, city agencies and
utilities in their territory, including all aspects pertaining to accessing (private or public) commercial
sources of finance and determining the “rules of the game” which intermediate the demand and supply
of financing. Beyond this, and within limits imposed by state governments, ULBs also have control over
certain factors that impact demand for financing (see Table 1).

     commercial financing of urban infrastructure


With some exceptions, state governments are responsible for the authorizing environment which
determines the base, scope, and levels of most types of major local own-source revenues (OSR), the full
set of ex-ante rules, regulations and procedures determining access to, and origination of, all sources of
finance, and dealing with ex-post situations in case of municipal/city default, reorganization, and debt
work-out arrangements. The national government plays the key role in determining the supply of private
finance for urban infrastructure through its role as the primary regulator and facilitator of financial
markets and financial institutions (FIs) countrywide.

Conceptually, the difference between “funding” and “financing” as two separate but related aspects
of commercial financing is important. “Financing” refers to the raising of money for investment needs,
whereas “funding” refers to the payment for the funds raised including financing costs. Financing raised
on a repayable basis, such as debt or PPP investment, needs recurrent revenue streams to pay the costs
of raising such financing (interest and principal for debt and return on equity for PPPs). These future
revenue streams are how such financing is funded. The more commercial financing raised, the higher
recurrent revenue needs to be to pay future obligations due to this financing. Thus, commercial financing
does not add to the total resource base of cities but is simply one of the tools available to cities to raise
resources for capital expenditure. Fiscal transfers and OSR, if stable and recurring, increase the funding
base available to raise more commercial financing.


The lay of the land: recent trends in financing and funding urban
infrastructure
How much investment is needed and how large is the financing gap
India’s cities require an estimated capital investment of USD 840 billion in urban infrastructure and
municipal services in the 15 years till 2036 (in 2020 prices), equivalent to 1.18% of estimated Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) over this period. This is equivalent to USD 108 per capita per year.2 Over half of
these investment needs–almost USD 450 billion–are in basic municipal services (i.e., water supply, sewerage,
municipal solid waste management (SWM), storm water drainage, urban roads and streetlighting), while



2	 Urban infrastructure and municipal services included in this estimate are urban transport (primarily mass transit /
metro rail); basic municipal services such a s water supply, sewerage, municipal solid waste management, storm water
drainage, urban roads and streetlighting; and social and community infrastructure but excludes housing and slum
upgrading.


Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                        9
the rest–USD 300 billion-are for mass transit. These needs are significantly higher than current levels of
investment. Total capital expenditure in urban infrastructure averaged only 0.6% of GDP in roughly the
past decade (2011-18) or USD 26 in per capita terms which, while growing steadily in recent years, is still
four times less than the per capita estimated needs (see Figure 2). While most investment in this period
has been in basic municipal services (around 0.48% of GDP), investment in metro-rail infrastructure has
witnessed stronger growth. Current levels of spending also appear to be below international comparators,
with China’s investment in urban infrastructure averaging 2.8% of GDP during the period 2000-143 and
USD 116 per capita in 2010 (McKinsey Global Institute 2010). Data on investment needs and the existing
financing gap in some large and highly urbanized states such as Gujarat and Tamil Nadu are in line with
these all-India data.

How urban infrastructure is currently financed
Private commercial financing plays a very minor role in financing urban infrastructure in India, as
most infrastructure is financed by intergovernmental fiscal transfers, especially in the shape of tied
grants. Fiscal transfers from states have increased substantially over the period FY11-18. The share of
ULBs’ revenue surpluses utilized to fund capital expenditure on a “pay-as-you-go” basis has substantially
declined, accounting for 15% of total capital expenditure and halving in share of GDP terms (see Figure 3).
The relative decline – and small nominal increase - in contribution of ULBs own-funds to capital investment
when compared to the substantial increase in fiscal transfers appears to reflect constraints in absorptive
capacity to execute higher levels of spending. Non-guaranteed commercial financing accounted for only
5% of total capital expenditure in urban infrastructure in this period. This includes debt financing by ULBs
(municipal bonds and loans) and PPPs. Commercial financing has been roughly equally split between
PPPs and debt. Loans from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation Ltd (HUDCO) make up the
rest of total capital expenditure (8%). Guaranteed by states, these are not considered commercial market-
based financing.

rail systems), water supply, wastewater treatment, municipal waste management, landscaping, flood control and city
energy systems (which comprises of district heating and cooking gas supply and accounted for <10% of total investment
in each of the years studied). Data from China’s Ministry of Housing and Urban–Rural Development. Source: Kangkang

The state of municipal finance: understanding the funding base for urban infrastructure
The overall funding base to raise substantial commercial for urban infrastructure in India appears to
be low at present, due to weak fiscal performance of cities (with low levels of OSR and service charges
relative to economic base) and low absorptive capacity for execution.

OSR are low relative to economic base while fiscal transfers are rapidly increasing. The overall scale
of finances at the city level is relatively modest. Total income of all ULBs nationwide from all sources
remained flat at around 1% of GDP during the FY11-18 period. Relatively slow growth and low levels of
OSR undermine future funding capacity. OSR as a share of total municipal revenue nationwide declined
from three-quarters to two-thirds, caused by slow absolute growth in OSR relative to fiscal transfers from
GoI and state governments. Total OSR of ULBs nationwide grew much slower than nominal GDP. Urban
property tax is the largest OSR but remains miniscule relative to comparators, being only 0.15% of GDP in
aggregate nationwide, compared to 0.3–0.6% of GDP for low- and middle-income countries on average
(Kelly, White and Anand 2020).

Low service charges for municipal services undermine financial sustainability and viability. Policy
decisions to keep tariffs and service charges below levels required for cost recovery and financial
sustainability are contributing to low revenue. ULBs and utilities are generally unable to recover operations
and maintenance (O&M) costs, let alone capital costs, of providing services such as water supply and
sewerage. Data for 14 large and medium-sized cities (including some of the largest cities in the country)
show that they recovered less than half of O&M costs pertaining to water supply on average in recent years.
Cost recovery by Indian urban utilities on average also appears to be below many comparator countries
including large federal countries (Brazil, Mexico) and other large middle-income countries (Colombia,
China, Egypt, Jordan, Russia, South Africa, Vietnam) (see Figure 4).

Absorptive and implementation capacity at ULBs for urban infrastructure delivery is low in ULBs. Large
ULBs across India have generally not been able to fully spend their budgeted capital expenditure in recent
years, with some large ULBs having extremely low capital budget execution rates. A review of 10 large
ULBs from across the country shows that they were able to spend only two-thirds of their cumulative
capital budget over the three recent FYs. Slow implementation performance by ULBs on several recent
flagship GoI Urban Missions further points to constraints on implementation capacity. ULBs across India
have so far executed only about one-fifth of the cumulative cost of approved projects under Smart Cities
Mission (SCM) and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) over the last six
FYs.4 This low implementation capacity in the context of increasing fiscal transfers is resulting in budget
surpluses which are not being used to finance capex. ULBs’ inability to invest their excess surplus points
to constrained capacity and incentives for capital expenditure.

The existing funding base to leverage higher private financing is concentrated in a few states and
large/metropolitan cities within them. Just four states (Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu)
account for over two-thirds of total OSR of all ULBs nationwide. Municipal corporations (MCs), being the
ULBs in large cities, account for a bulk of total OSR and revenue surplus nationwide.




4	 The total cost of projects approved under these missions is USD 27 billion and USD 10 billion for SCM and AMRUT respectively,
of which ULBs have been able to execute only 22% (SCM) and 18% (AMRUT) respectively so far.

The state of private financing for urban infrastructure: Debt and PPPs
The mirage of municipal debt financing
Total annual issuances of commercial debt financing for ULBs, including loans and bonds, was muted
in the period FY11-18, ranging between USD 156–311 million of annual issuances. In comparison, loans
from HUDCO, guaranteed by state governments, have accounted for a much larger share of capital
expenditure. Municipal bonds are very small relative to commercial loans, being less than one-tenth
of total commercial debt raised by ULBs in this period. Only five cities have issued bonds in the last 4
years, despite 28 MCs securing investment grade credit ratings under AMRUT and substantial incentives
available from GoI. The market for municipal bonds is small relative to comparable countries. Total value
of outstanding municipal bond debt is one-sixth of outstanding municipal bonds in South Africa which
has a well-developed municipal bond market (see Figure 5).

Private debt financing has primarily been raised by a few large ULBs across the country, with cities
from only 7 states accounting for all municipal bond issuances in India till date. Only a handful of large
cities have accessed institutional/bank loans. In fact, the volume of “commercial debt financing” actually
does not reflect true private financing provided on a market basis as it also includes loans from state
government-controlled FIs which lend public funds and contribute a substantial share of debt financing
for cities, especially in Tamil Nadu, where entities like the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF)
and Tamil Nadu Urban Finance and Infrastructure Development Company (TUFIDCO) provide loans on
concessional terms. These entities do not themselves leverage or raise private financing for their capital
needs directly, thus this lending does not really represent additional finance leveraged from the private
sector. Rather, these are fiscal resources which circulate within the public sector.

Having noted this, it is also important to identify a certain paradox relating to financing activities of
larger cities in India: current level of debt financing in these cities is well below their existing debt
servicing potential. 27 of the largest ULBs nationwide (excluding Mumbai) which received an investment
grade credit rating under AMRUT can currently borrow an additional USD 7.7 – 8.4 billion in debt based
on their existing financial indicators, which is more than 20 times their existing level of debt stock.


Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                      13
 Mumbai alone can currently borrow an additional USD 5 billion given its current estimated debt servicing
 capacity. Such a large gap between intrinsic potential and existing levels points to a complex combination
 of constraints which inhibit these relatively capable cities from accessing higher levels of commercial
 finance. The additional debt potential beyond these few top-tier cities is low, however, on account of the
 concentration of the revenue base and operating surpluses in large cities. Even in the large cities, this
 estimated potential is certainly limited relative to total investment needs.

 The existing narrow and non-buoyant OSR base can impair the total future debt carrying capacity
 of ULBs and presents a binding constraint to expand private financing even in larger cities. In Tamil
 Nadu for example, growth in revenue income and OSR of state-wide ULBs and Chennai agencies has
 substantially lagged growth in revenue expenditure, resulting in declining operating surpluses and limiting
 the potential debt servicing capacity. State governments there generally control most substantial aspects
 of commercial financing and investment decisions by ULBs and city agencies, approving transactions on
 a case-by-case basis and having a strong role in approval and appraisal of capital investment needs.


 The unfulfilled promise of PPPs
 PPP transactions for urban infrastructure have seen a marked decline in the last decade both in
 monetary value and transaction volume. Only one-third of all PPP investments awarded since 2000 came
 in the last decade (see Figure 6). Municipal SWM projects had the highest share (by volume and value) in
 the last decade, and ULBs accounted for almost two-thirds of PPPs by value in the last decade with the
 rest being awarded by parastatals. As in OSR performance and debt financing, the same set of four states
 accounted for a majority of PPP transaction value and volume in the last decade, with Maharashtra alone
 accounting for almost half of them by monetary value.

 PPPs in urban infrastructure have needed sizable funding support, often in the shape of capital grants
 from state governments and GoI as viability gap funding and/or availability payments. City agencies
 have been unable to expand the resource and funding base to support private financing as user charges
 for water supply, sewerage networks, and bus services are particularly highly subsidized from general
 revenues, sourced from either OSR or fiscal transfers, and do not recover even O&M costs. These are also


 14                                                                                       Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
the revenues which are used to fund debt service costs for municipal borrowing, and thus there is a
zero-sum relationship between these two financing sources (borrowing and PPPs). Even in “attributable”
urban services where the end-user/beneficiary is distinctly identifiable and can be charged for the service,
PPP potential is constrained by the existing revenue structure which undermines their viability for private
investors. Moreover, the design of PPPs has not fully accounted for risk-sharing or risk-transfer mechanisms
for project risks, with several PPPs in Tamil Nadu facing operational issues due to unanticipated demand
shocks and technical and legal challenges which resulted in them requiring restructuring and coming
into public ownership.


Key factors impacting private financing for urban infrastructure
The primary constraints preventing higher volume of private financing for urban infrastructure in India
are on the demand side. These are: the policy and political economy decisions impacting revenue levels
and funding base for private financing; weak absorptive and implementation capacity of city agencies for
capital expenditure; and the restrictive inter-governmental framework which reduces accountability and
incentives for city agencies to invest more ambitiously in infrastructure. The next most critical constraint
appears to be state-level regulatory and policy factors which intermediate demand and supply of finance.
These are aggravated by a set of secondary constraints including factors related to the financial market
that dampen supply of finance, and weak financial management and fiduciary performance. Table 2
summarizes these constraints.

urban infrastructure in India

                                            weaknesses (e.g. weak strategic planning to develop pipeline of
                                            viable projects; low capacity to design and structure complex
                                            projects/PPP transactions and deal with private investors/FIs

Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                        15
In sum, the persistently low level of private financing in urban infrastructure is primarily a fiscal and
institutional problem. Private financing will remain constrained until these fiscal and institutional realities
shift, with cities developing the absorptive capacities and related incentives to invest more aggressively
in urban infrastructure; and policy decisions are taken to increase taxes and user-charges to required
levels so that the financing required for infrastructure can be funded and repaid. In other words the
most fundamental reforms to increase private financing for urban infrastructure have little to do directly
with such financing itself. Increasing private financing to a level that makes a substantial contribution to
urban infrastructure needs depends on improving the revenue base, creditworthiness, and institutional
capacity of ULBs and city agencies.

It should also be stressed that, notwithstanding these system-wide constraints, there is nonetheless a
group of larger, high-potential cities which are currently not leveraging private commercial financing
commensurate with their debt servicing potential and which should be the target of focused efforts to
expand commercial financing volumes to increase infrastructure investment. While the potential here
is limited relative to the total investment needs – demonstrating that these cities, too, are subject to the
broader fiscal and institutional realities of all ULBs in India – it is nonetheless significant relative to the
existing low levels of commercial financing. These cities account for a fifth of India’s urban population.
This presents fertile ground for targeted incremental action, both to make a difference in these cities
themselves and for its wider demonstration effects.


Proposals for policy actions along two pathways: structural reforms and
incremental actions
The proposals for policy action are directed at the following two levels:

     •	   Structural reforms required to address the systemic constraints to which all cities are subject –
          which are also the most difficult, not least because they require political decisions which have
          proven to be challenging in the Indian context;5
     •	   Targeted actions aimed at increasing the mobilization of private commercial financing by high-
          potential cities in the short- and medium-term. These actions are arguably feasible immediately, at
          least in some cities and states.

Structural reforms to address core fiscal and institutional constraints:
The following reforms will address some of the core fiscal, institutional and revenue constraints that face
and have a fundamental impact across the system on increasing private financing:

     •	   The fiscal transfer system (at both national and state levels) should move to a more stable,
          formula-based, and unconditional fiscal transfer regime. About half of all fiscal transfers to
          ULBs currently are tied funds which creates accountability and incentive issues. The 15th Finance
          Commission report also recommends an increase in unconditional transfers to ULBs to 0.32% of
          GDP by FY25. Well-designed conditional transfers can also improve outcomes.
     •	   Cities’ fiscal base and creditworthiness will be improved by addressing revenue constraints
          through increasing property taxes, user fees and service charges from the current low bases
          substantially in real terms. Doubling the OSR of key ULBs and parastatal agencies every five years
          can support a funding base sufficient enough to mobilize substantial commercial financing to
          contribute to meeting investment needs.
     •	   Gradually increasing the service delivery mandates of city agencies will improve their
          accountability and incentives consistent with principles of the 74th Constitutional Amendment
          Act. Devolution of water and sewerage functions may be a starting point.




5	 The fact that these reforms are outlined here does not imply that it is believed these reforms are likely. As noted,
the areas to be addressed may not be tractable in the short-medium term. The point, however, is that the scope
for mobilizing private commercial finance into urban infrastructure will always be limited to the extent that these
constraints are not addressed.


16                                                                     Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
Targeted actions to provide incremental progress in selected high potential cities:
A group of large, financially endowed cities are ready for focused support to catalyze financing as they
have a relatively strong revenue base which is not currently being fully leveraged relative to potential.
States have a primary role in creating the enabling conditions for this and supporting necessary city
actions, while GoI can provide additional technical assistance using its position as regulator, convener,
and facilitator. Specific actions are proposed as follows:


state-level actions to address constraints on demand for financing and the regulatory environment
   •	   Improving cities’ absorptive capacity
         ̵ Supporting specific large cities with strategic multi-year capital investment and financial
         	
           planning, building a pipeline of investment projects, and helping operationalize these plans.
         ̵ Improving capacity of ULBs and city agencies in large cities to develop and implement
         	
           bankable projects and complex PPP transactions. This should be done through technical
           assistance and advisory to strengthen institutional capacity and creditworthiness of ULBs and
           parastatals to position them as credible counterparties for private investors and FIs.
         ̵ Program of performance-based fiscal transfers to improve absorptive and institutional capacity
         	
           of ULBs across a range of required aspects. Such a program can link performance-based fiscal
           transfers to institutional results rather than tied to specific projects.
   •	   Improving cities’ fiduciary & public financial management quality and OSR performance:
        implementing accounting, auditing, and financial disclosure standards for ULBs and availability and
        consistency of reliable financial data; improving capacity of ULBs to collect revenue from assigned
        sources. This provides confidence to investors on the overall quality of financial management and
        revenue systems.
   •	   Revising regulatory environment to create more conducive conditions for municipal borrowing
        and PPP activity:
         ̵ Revising ex-ante rules and procedures governing ULB access to private finance especially
         	
           borrowing. States should transition to a rules-based process instead of a direct control system
           whereby every transaction is approved on a case-by-case basis
         ̵ Clarifying and improving ex-post procedures to provide dispute resolution with investors and
         	
           deal with potential defaults by ULB on borrowing. Systematic support is needed for dispute
           resolution between city agencies and investors/creditors, for both borrowing and PPPs, to
           reduce investors’ risk perception.
         ̵ Reforming state-controlled FIs to transition from concessional financiers to more sophisticated
         	
           entities which facilitate private financing. These institutions could eventually become financial
           support facilities which provide technical support and/or financing to city agencies for project/
           transaction preparation and financing or credit enhancement through limited underwriting
           designed crowd-in private financing.

Central Government-level actions to support ambitious reform agenda and incremental progress
   •	   Facilitation, technical assistance, capacity building and removing market frictions

Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                          19
Chapter 1.
Introduction: Rationale, Scope, and Approach
1.1. Problem statement & rationale for this report
India is rapidly urbanizing, and the financing needs of cities are expanding proportionately. India’s
urban population is estimated to increase by 140 million over the next 15 years, from 470 million in 2021
to 600 million by 2036. This will be 40% of the total national population, up from 31% in 2011.6 Population
growth in urban areas will account for three quarters of the total national population increase in the 25-
year period from 2011 to 2036. This rapid urbanization, along with existing service delivery gaps, is putting
substantial pressure on infrastructure and livability in cities. A sustained increase in capital investment is
needed in cities to enable economic growth, improve quality of living and livability, and build resilience to
the expected impacts of climate change.

Cities face significant challenges to mobilize the needed finance for these needs, and the financing gap
is large. Government of India (GoI) had previously estimated that US$560 billion in capital investment will
be required for urban infrastructure and services for the 20-year period 2012-32 (HPEC 2011)7, equivalent to
an annual financing requirement of US$42 billion on average. GoI’s 12th Five Year Plan had also estimated
the urban infrastructure financing deficit to be 80% of investment needs8 and had underscored the
potential for financing from private sources to bridge this gap – including municipal borrowing and
public-private partnerships (PPPs).

Despite a substantial increase in inter-governmental fiscal transfers to cities in the last decade, cities
still face a large shortfall of resources relative to investment needs and will require financing from
additional sources – especially private commercial financing. To bridge this financing gap, GoI and
several states and cities have taken measures to enable commercial financing, but its use remains very
limited. Despite GoI having introduced several policy measures and incentive mechanisms to create an
enabling environment at the national level, cities – even financially strong ones - have not substantially
mobilized private financing to invest in urban infrastructure. Clearly, systemic constraints exist which
prevent cities from tapping much larger volumes of private financing for their infrastructure needs.

This report aims to identify these key constraints to bridging the urban infrastructure financing gap
in India, especially through potential private financing. To this end, it presents updated estimates of
urban infrastructure investment needs and analyses recent and historic trends in capital investment
and commercial financing for urban infrastructure. It provides policy proposals on how the identified
constraints can be addressed by GoI, states and cities. The scope of private financing considered in this
report includes two primary sources: borrowing/debt financing and PPPs.

This report is part of a larger analytical and technical assistance activity undertaken by the World
Bank and synthesizes the analysis and findings of three detailed background reports prepared under
this activity. These background reports including the following: (a) a national-level diagnostic of the
use of commercial financing instruments for urban infrastructure in India, which presents the policy
and regulatory landscape at the national level and captures key trends on the use of various financing
instruments for urban investment; and (b) two state-level deep dive reports, one each for Gujarat and
Tamil Nadu, which review in detail each state’s trends and needs for urban infrastructure investment, and
the prevailing regulatory framework and constraints for various commercial financing instruments. These
state-level reports also provide detailed assessments for the largest city in each state, i.e., Ahmedabad
(Gujarat) and Chennai (Tamil Nadu).9

1.2. How this report is organized
Chapter 2 presents a conceptual framework for assessing the key factors that influence the mobilization
of commercial finance for investment in urban infrastructure. It also describes India’s inter-governmental
fiscal and institutional system for urban governance and financing considering the conceptual framework,
including the role of the central government as regulator and facilitator of financial markets and the role
of state governments and their relationship with Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and other city agencies such
as utilities.

Chapter 3 provides the lay of the land on recent trends in financing and funding for urban infrastructure
in India. It provides estimates on the quantum of financing needed over the next decade and the existing
and estimated financing gap, comparing needs relative to existing levels of investment. It shows the
sources of financing for capital investment on urban infrastructure and the types of agencies executing
these investments. This chapter also describes the current state of municipal finance in India, aiming to
understand the size of the funding base for urban infrastructure by looking at fiscal performance of cities.

Chapter 4 describes the state of commercial financing for urban infrastructure by focusing on two types
of financing: debt / borrowing, and PPPs. It shows the recent trends for both these types and makes key
observations to explain these trends. It also provides an estimation of the potential size of debt that can be
incurred by large, creditworthy cities over the next decade based on existing fiscal indicators.

Chapter 5 applies the conceptual framework to empirically analyze the key factors impacting the potential
mobilization of commercial finance for urban infrastructure investment in India. It describes the specific
constraints and assesses their relative importance.

Chapter 6 follows this analysis to provide proposals for policy actions to address the identified constraints.
Proposals are divided between those which are the responsibility of the central and state governments
and include shorter-term actions which can provide incremental progress as well as more fundamental
reforms needed for more substantial impact on increasing private financing.


1.3. Methodology and Approach
This report, and its associated background reports, have been prepared primarily using secondary
research, data, and information available in the public domain, especially that pertaining to urban
investment, municipal finance indicators, and commercial financing for urban infrastructure with a focus
on debt financing and PPPs. In some instances, primary data and information have been collected from
Government counterparts in the states of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, including in the cities of Chennai (Tamil
Nadu) and Ahmedabad (Gujarat).10

The review of trends in urban capital expenditure and estimated needs involved looking at all-India data in
urban capex and finances of ULBs and state governments. Urban capex was estimated based on reported
expenditure of state governments and ULBs and triangulation with reported capex under GoI flagship
schemes and reported information on commercial financing. Annual urban capex figures for the last
decade were arrived at through careful triangulation from these sources. Normative investment needs
for the upcoming 15 years (from FY21 to FY36) were based on a review of earlier studies and additional
inputs in the urban transport category, using and calibrating existing models and estimations by other
sources as needed. These future investment estimates are based on a review of past estimates with a
focus on building scenarios for assessing the scale of commercial financing needed. While due care has
been taken to cross-reference and validate information reviewed and analyzed, the report recognizes
limitations in information and the multiplicity of datasets on urban financial performance. The analyses
were also constrained by limited information on aggregate financial and investment data for parastatal
agencies. Several analyses of aggregates are based on finances of ULBs, although many of the conclusions
apply to parastatals too.

Data and analyses on municipal debt/borrowing are primarily for ULBs and selected city agencies such as
utilities – especially in the cases of detailed data from Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Data and analyses on urban
infrastructure PPPs, however, is more comprehensive and aims to include all urban PPPs regardless of
type of executing agency, including ULBs, utilities, parastatals, and other city agencies. It is recognized that
many other agencies besides ULBs also deliver urban infrastructure (e.g. state departments; state-owned
urban entities such as water utilities; Urban Development Authorities), but these are predominantly part
of state governments, or are owned by state governments, and the borrowing activities of such entities
would be more accurately understood as lying in the broad realm of state borrowing. Thus, they are not
included in the data and analysis on debt/borrowing in this report. They are, however, included in analysis
of PPPs to the extent such information was available.

For some instances where more granular data and analyses are presented for Gujarat and Tamil Nadu
states – and the cities of Ahmedabad and Chennai - urban investment needs were estimated using
normative assumptions, priority projects and programs identified by the respective city agencies. Financial
projections for income, expenditure, and source-wise financing were projected for a 15-year period to
establish financing gaps under various scenarios.


1.4. Potential impact of Covid-19 pandemic
The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased uncertainty in the level and growth of
urban finances at the state and city levels and may impact investment capacity and private financing
potential in the short to medium term. It is possible that urban capital expenditure could fall in the
ongoing FY22 from an already low base. A fall in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at the national
level is likely to impact revenues at all levels of government. The pandemic has also increased pressure on
expenses for city agencies. As shown in this report, there is substantial variation across the country in the
immediate impact of the pandemic on city finances, with large cities in some states seeing declines in
revenue while others have fared far better. In general, there has been pressure to increase fiscal transfers to
meet additional urgent expenditures relating to the pandemic. Lower revenues and higher expenditures
for ULBs may affect their credit ratings and debt carrying capacity, making it even more challenging to
accessing debt. The pandemic may also impact investor appetite in general which will add uncertainty.

For the analyses and policy recommendations in this report, while the impact of Covid-19 has been
factored in forward-looking projections and scenarios by incorporating a drop in economic output and
associated decline in revenue in the immediate term along with a follow-up stabilization and recovery
period, a specific analysis of the same is beyond the scope of this report, given the pandemic’s evolving
nature. It should be noted that all historical data shown in this report are for periods prior to the onset of
the pandemic.

Conceptual Framework and its Relevance to
India’s Urban Governance and Finance Structure
This Chapter presents a conceptual framework for assessing key factors that influence the mobilization
of commercial finance for urban infrastructure and how it applies to India’s inter-governmental fiscal and
institutional system including the role of the central government as regulator and facilitator of financial
markets and the role of state governments and their relationship with ULBs and other city agencies. A
glossary of terms used in this report related to types of (commercial) financing is provided in Box 1.

Box 1. Glossary of terms used for types of commercial financing

  Commercial financing: This refers to any financing provided on a repayable basis. This includes all
  such financing regardless of its terms (i.e. whether it is provided on a subsidized/concessional basis
  or not; or supported by any guarantees or other credit enhancement features). It is also regardless
  of the source of financing (i.e. either any private sector or public sector financial institutions (FIs)/
  investor). It includes all types of debt such as loans and proceeds from municipal bonds, including
  financing from public sector entities such as national or state-controlled FIs which lend public funds
  and contribute a substantial share of debt financing for cities. This type of financing also includes all
  types of public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements where private investor(s) provide equity and
  debt financing (or any other financial contribution) and receive monetary benefits such as returns
  on their equity/financing or other monetary payments as consideration for its investment. Repayable
  basis implies the repayment of principal and the associated financing costs such as interest (in the
  case of borrowing) and returns on equity/investment in case of PPPs.

  Market based financing: This refers to commercial (repayable) financing which is provided without
  subsidy or concession, and is thus market based, regardless of financing source. This can be in the
  shape of non-concessional bank loans, investment in financial instruments such as municipal bonds,
  or equity for PPP transactions. It includes financing from financial markets, scheduled commercial
  banks (SCBs, including public sector banks, either nationalized or owned by a government agency,
  which provide financing on market basis), and specialized infrastructure finance entities that are
  privately owned or have only partial or indirect public ownership (and provide financing on market
  basis).

  Private commercial financing, or private financing, is such market-based financing which is
  providing by private sector FIs/investors (including such publicly owned FIs/banks which operate
  on market basis, e.g. government-owned SCBs or other institutions listed on stock exchanges etc.).
  This category is the core focus of this report, as a material improvement in the status quo of urban
  infrastructure investment is likely to require substantially higher private financing on market basis.

  Private financing is different from public commercial financing in a subtle but important manner.
  Public commercial financing is provided by public sector FIs (either on market or concessional basis,
  such as various state government FIs who lend to urban projects without any explicit guarantees by
  state governments). This distinction is made because, in principle, public sector FIs can also provide
  financing to city agencies on market basis. But in general, such FIs (at the national and state levels)
  provide financing on a non-market basis, including loans supported by guarantees (such as HUDCO
  loans guaranteed by state governments). Another aspect distinguishing this from private financing
  is that it generally such financing circulates within the public sector – from the public sector FI to the
  implementing agency – without leveraging any private sector financing.

2.1. Conceptual framework for demand and supply of commercial financing
for urban infrastructure
This report modifies an existing conceptual framework, previously applied to India and other emerging
and developing economies, which describes the key factors determining the potential flow, size, and
scope of private financing for urban infrastructure.11 There are six key factors that determine the demand
for, and supply of, private commercial financing for urban infrastructure (see Figure 7). These factors
apply to any country and subnational context, including national and state levels in India.

2.1.1. Demand for private finance
Demand for private financing is determined by the absorptive capacity of city agencies and municipal
creditworthiness. Municipal creditworthiness is in turn determined as a combination of several factors,
including the inter-governmental fiscal and institutional framework, policy decisions on revenue levels,
and fiduciary quality and performance. Municipal creditworthiness relies on the availability of predictable
revenue streams (including recurrent fiscal transfers and own-source revenues (OSR)) as well as quality
and performance of municipal financial management. Each of the factors affecting demand for private
financed is described below:

Absorptive capacity of city governments and agencies. Absorptive capacity refers to the ability (and
capacity) of city governments (ULBs in the case of India) and other city agencies to plan and spend the
financing currently or potentially available to them for capital infrastructure investment needs, regardless
of source. It also includes their capabilities (internal or externally sourced) to engage effectively with private
sector investors/financiers and design the financial and commercial structures for private financing of
urban infrastructure projects.

There are several indicators of absorptive capacity, which include the following: the existence of
medium-term strategic development plans listing clear investment and expenditure prioritization;
a pipeline of technically and operationally viable projects based on such strategic plans; the ability to
design, prepare, appraise and implement high quality projects having strong feasibility, viability or strong
economic and social returns; high execution and implementation rates of previous and ongoing capital



 	 This framework was introduced in World Bank (2011) and further developed in White and Wahba (2019).

expenditures and investment projects; and capacity, skills, expertise and experience in dealing with more
sophisticated sources of finance, including commercial lenders and/or private investors, along with ability
to develop sophisticated commercial financing and risk-sharing mechanisms for urban infrastructure
projects especially PPPs. ULBs and city agencies in India can influence this factor to some degree, within
institutional and regulatory limits imposed by state governments.

Inter-governmental fiscal and institutional framework. The existing fiscal framework at the national
and state levels - including fiscal transfers, revenue and expenditure assignments and mandates for ULBs
- directly influences their ability to generate operational surpluses that are used for debt service, public
investment expenditures and PPP transactions. The scope of institutional responsibility for the provision
of infrastructure also directly influences demand for financing – a ULB or city agency will obviously only
be able to invest in those services for which it has legal mandates. The ability of cities to attract private
finance depends in part on sources of revenue available to them to help pay various financing costs – such
as interest (for debt financing), return on equity (for PPP financing), etc. These sources of revenue may
include both OSR and inter-governmental fiscal transfers from higher levels of government (i.e. national
and state). Fiscal transfers, especially those made on a stable, predictable, and recurrent basis, enhance
the total funding capacity of ULBs since they are made on a non-repayable basis and do not have any
financing cost. Due to this, they are the preferred (and often default) source of investment financing
for ULBs. Their predictable nature also enhances ULBs’ creditworthiness by providing a stable stream of
recurrent revenue. Larger assignments for OSR also enhance the potential total funding capacity of ULBs
since they can contribute to higher operational surpluses which the ULB can utilize for capital expenditure
or future financing costs of commercial financing. These aspects collectively impact the size and scope of
financing required by and available to cities. ULBs have limited to no control over this factor, with primary
responsibility resting with national and state governments.

Policy decisions on revenue levels. A related but somewhat distinct aspect of the inter-governmental
framework is the policy decisions on the local revenues relative to costs of service provision and
infrastructure. If policy decisions are taken to keep revenues (local taxes such as property tax as well as
service charges for municipal services) below the levels required to provide urban services, then other
revenue sources – such as fiscal transfers or other receipts - are needed to fill this fiscal gap. Local tax
revenues and service charges at appropriate levels contribute to higher operational surpluses which the
ULB can utilize for capital expenditure or future financing costs of commercial financing. Tax revenue
and service charges well below the required levels for financial sustainability undermine the viability of
engaging private sector partners in infrastructure without substantial fiscal support. This is especially
the case for PPPs which often require adequate levels of service charges to ensure viability, absent which
substantial fiscal support is required.

Besides revenue policy, ULBs’ performance in collecting/mobilizing revenue from their assigned sources–
regardless of decisions on rates/levels–determines the size of their operating surpluses to pay future
financing. Thus, ULBs’ ability and capacity to collect revenue from these assigned sources impacts how
much financing they can raise. In India, both ULBs and states have control over this factor, depending
on the specific policy context in each state, with ULBs having more influence over revenue mobilization
effort.

Quality of municipal financial management, financial data, and other fiduciary aspects. Demand for
private financing depends on the fiduciary, institutional and management capacity of ULBs. This includes
quality of municipal accounting and financial management systems, availability and consistency of reliable
financial data and human resources responsible for running ULBs. These provide confidence to investors/
financiers on the overall quality of financial management and fiduciary systems. As noted elsewhere, “in
order to make sensible credit and investment decisions investors need to be able to understand municipal
accounts and balance sheets and have confidence in the overall quality of financial management
systems.” (White and Wahba 2019) This factor is also dependent on the quality of their fiduciary systems,
human resources, and information technology tools, among others. ULBs have relatively strong influence
and control over this factor – and can improve it through specific actions.

2.1.2. Supply of private finance
Depth and character of the financial sector. The supply of private commercial finance is primarily
determined by the size, sophistication, and regulatory environment of the domestic financial market as
it pertains to private commercial financing for ULBs and capital for urban infrastructure; as well as the
nature and behavior of investors and financial institutions (FIs) who are the suppliers of private finance. In
India, the national government regulates all aspects of financial markets, directly impacting the supply of
financing. These include central bank regulations, tax treatment of investments in urban infrastructure,
municipal bond listing requirements issued by SEBI, and regulations pertaining to investments made by
large institutional investors such as insurance and provident funds. Investors – either large institutional
investors or other private sector entities – respond to this regulatory environment and the incentives and
constraints imposed by it. State governments also play a role in determining supply, albeit a limited one,
due to the existence of state government-owned FIs in several states which finance urban infrastructure
spending. ULBs in India have almost no role in determining this factor.


2.1.3. Intermediation of demand and supply
Regulatory framework for private financing of urban infrastructure. Considered the “rules of the game”,
the regulatory framework for private financing intermediates the supply and demand for at the level
of every investment and transaction. This includes matters such as whether, and how much, ULBs and
city agencies (and which agencies in particular cities) are authorized to access financing; the types of
collateral such ULBs may pledge; currency restrictions; rights of ULBs to enter long-term PPP contracts and
determine tariffs for urban services; etc. ULBs in India have almost no control over establishing the rules
of the game, with primary responsibility resting with national and state governments. In general, these
rules of the game comprise several inter-related aspects such as: the full set of ex-ante rules, regulations
and procedures governing all aspects of ULB/agency access to, and origination of, all types of commercial
finance; regulations pertaining to investors in municipal risk; information on, and monitoring of, municipal
debt; and procedures to deal with instances of default (or other distress) on financing obligations.


2.2. Understanding the difference between funding and financing
It is important to highlight the difference between “funding” and “financing” as two separate but
related conceptual aspects of discussions on commercial financing of urban infrastructure. Financing
refers to the raising of money for investment needs, whereas funding refers to the payment for the
investment, including the financing costs, over the long term. Any financing raised on a repayable basis
- such as loans (from any source), municipal bonds issuances, private investment financing through
PPPs etc. - needs stable and recurrent future revenue streams to be able to pay the costs of raising such
financing – which is interest in the case of debt (municipal bonds or loans from banks and other FIs),
besides the repayment of principal, and return on equity in the case of private investment through PPPs
and similar transactions. These future revenue streams to pay the financing costs are how such financing
is funded.

Therefore, there is a necessarily direct and positive relationship between increased (private) financing
and the need for increased future recurrent revenue streams to fund and repay this increased financing.
The more a city agency taps any commercial financing, the more recurrent revenue it needs in the
future to pay the obligations due to this financing. For ULBs to mobilize more finance, there is a need to
demonstrate the ability and commitment to pay for that finance with recurrent revenues - either local
(own source) revenues (taxes, service charges etc.) or inter-governmental fiscal transfers from higher levels
of government (national and state). The only type of financing which does not create funding obligations
is one that does not require to be repaid – such as inter-governmental fiscal transfers (usually made on
grant basis) or a city’s own operating surplus derived from excess of recurrent revenues over expenses.

Commercial financing does not add to the total resource base available to pay for infrastructure
investment in the long term – it is not additional revenue. The rationale for commercial financing thus
does not derive from expanding the overall resource base to fund such investments but from imperatives
related to financing efficiency, inter-generational equity and so on. Such financing should be sought only
in proportion to the future expansion of the fiscal resources which are available to fund the financing costs.


26                                                               Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
Commercial financing is simply one of the tools available to city agencies to raise sufficient resources
for capital investment/expenditure. Figure 8 illustrates with an example: if the total cost of a given project
is 100% (any monetary unit), part of it can be financed through two sources: first, operating surpluses of
the city which result from the excess of revenue/recurrent income (usually comprised of fiscal transfers
and OSR) over revenue/recurrent expenditure – this is zero-cost financing as it does not need to be repaid
and also comprises the “funding base” to the extent that this revenue is recurrent or predictable. The
second source is commercial financing raised from external sources on returnable basis.

        Fiscal Transfers	      Own Source Revenue	          Commercial Financing (Debt/PPP)


Inter-governmental fiscal transfers and OSR impact commercial financing in the following way: Stable
and recurring fiscal transfers – those which are formula-based, predictable and unconditional – and OSR
form part of the funding base available to raise more commercial financing. The higher such reliable fiscal
transfers and OSR are, the higher operating surpluses can potentially be, and the more financing can be
raised since the underlying base of recurrent revenues permits the leveraging of this financing.


2.3. India’s inter-governmental framework for urban governance and
financing for infrastructure and service delivery
2.3.1. Role of state governments and relationship between state and city levels
Constitutional mandate of ULBs and its varied implementation: state Governments have full powers
to regulate all activities of ULBs in their territory, including all municipal finance activity, as per the
Constitution of India. Although the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 formally recognized
local governments (ULBs for urban areas) as the third-tier of government after national and state levels,
and identified several municipal functions (including urban planning, land-use regulation, water supply,
sanitation, wastewater, solid waste management (SWM), roads and transport infrastructure, housing etc.),
the implementation and scope of this remit was assigned to the discretion of state governments under
the 12th schedule of the Constitution. Further, while the 74th Amendment also defined the range of
expenditures to be assigned to ULBs from the state level, again the scope and implementation of this
mandate – as well as local revenue assignments – was assigned to the discretion of states. Consequently,
there is variation between states in the prevalent institutional framework for urban service delivery and
the functions and mandates of ULBs.

Paramount role of state governments in urban service delivery and infrastructure: While there is diversity
in the mandates of ULBs among states, very often there is a fractured functional devolution of urban service
delivery mandates (with associated expenditure and revenue assignment) to ULBs and urban agencies in
most states. The functional mandates of many municipal/urban services and infrastructure lies with state
government departments and state-controlled or -owned agencies and parastatals, barring a few states
such as Maharashtra and Gujarat. Even in cases where city-level parastatal agencies (e.g., water boards


Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                  27
and city bus transport corporations) have been created with the intention of building specific expertise,
these are rarely empowered with commensurate delegation of powers, mandates, and accountability for
service delivery. Thus, relative to state-level agencies, ULBs and utilities generally have limited expenditure
assignments and scope of institutional responsibility for the provision of infrastructure and services. Further,
in several states including highly urbanized ones such as Tamil Nadu, revenue collected from most land-
based revenue instruments goes directly into the state government budget and, even in instances where it
is collected by city-level agencies, is not retained by such agencies. In some cases, a portion of such revenue
is re-allocated back to city-level agencies and ULBs.

This relationship between state governments and ULBs/city agencies underpins and influences all
aspects of infrastructure financing regardless of source of financing – commercial (public or private)
or otherwise. State governments have the primary responsibility to regulate the mandates, scope, and
financial activities of all ULBs, city agencies and utilities in their territory, including all aspects pertaining
to accessing (private or public) commercial sources of finance and determining the “rules of the game”
which intermediate the demand and supply of financing. Beyond this, and within limits imposed by state
governments, ULBs also have control over certain factors that impact demand for financing, including
absorptive capacity, policy and mobilization efforts for those revenue sources assigned to them, and
fiduciary quality (see Table 3).

With some exceptions, state governments are responsible for the following:

     •	    The authorizing environment which determines the base, scope, and levels of most types of
           major local OSR (e.g. property taxes, service fees/charges and other rates and tariffs), and therefore
           determines the level of “funding” potentially available to cover the costs of any commercial financing
           to be raised. As noted above, the level of funding determines the sustainable level of commercial
           financing potentially available to any city agency, and thus places an indirect cap on total financing
           which can be raised.




28                                                                    Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
     •	   The full set of ex-ante rules, regulations and procedures determining access to, and origination
          of, all sources of finance. This includes regulations and procedures pertaining to the purpose,
          authorization, limits, financial characteristics, tenor, types of securities offered, sources of repayment
          and accounting, reporting and disclosures related to borrowing or bond issues, and similar aspects
          for PPP transactions especially rates and levels of tariffs, service charges etc.
     •	   Dealing with ex-post situations including potential state intervention in case of municipal/city
          default, reorganization, and debt work-out arrangements. State governments have considerable
          powers to intervene in such cases and municipal legislation in most states provides substantial
          authority to allow the state government to attach all monies of the ULB for this purpose. However, in
          general these ex-post regulations are weak and there are limited to no institutionalized frameworks
          or procedures to implement such an intervention. As “public bodies”, the applicability of national-
          level debt recovery statutes including the recent Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and the
          National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is not clear.
There is variation across states in the level of decentralization and empowerment of ULBs, with some
states providing more autonomy to ULBs than others. Gujarat and Tamil Nadu illustrate this variation well:

     •	   Gujarat seems to have a progressive policy and de facto regulatory framework for empowerment
          of ULBs. A key feature is the extensive functional decentralization to ULBs, with all 18 functions in
          the 12th Schedule of Constitution of India recommended for transfer having been devolved to ULBs.
          Gujarat is among the few states in the country (along with Maharashtra) that provides wide-ranging
          powers to Municipal Corporations (MCs), which are ULBs in urban areas having population of more
          than one million) with respect to capital expenditure, with a strong delegation of financial powers
          where the elected council and standing committees are empowered to take decisions on capital
          expenditure from their own funds without seeking approvals from the state government. Once
          the elected body approves projects to be financed from own funds, the ULB’s standing committee
          can approve tendering for the same. Fiduciary capacity and public financial management are also
          stronger, with accrual accounting standards having been implemented universally across all ULBs.
     •	   In Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, the state government has a strong decision-making role in
          approving individual projects for ULB execution. Delegation of powers to ULBs is low relative to the
          scale of capital expenditure, even in large MCs. Further, key municipal functions are undertaken
          by state government agencies (i.e., Departments, Authorities, agencies, etc.). The situation in Tamil
          Nadu is generally reflective of most states, regardless of levels of urbanization and economic growth.

2.3.2. Role of National government as regulator and facilitator of financial markets
The national government plays the key role in determining the supply of private finance for urban
infrastructure, through its role as the primary regulator and facilitator of financial markets and FIs
countrywide. GoI has the power to regulate lenders and lending instruments through the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI), and financial markets through the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the tax
regime surrounding investment/financing for urban infrastructure through the Ministry of Finance (e.g.
guidelines for tax-free bonds), and the issuance of government securities. In addition, several GoI laws
and regulations, some of which have state-specific regulations, possibly impact municipal borrowing too,
the most notable of which pertain to procurement and anti-corruption (Central Vigilance Commission)
and debt recovery (SARFAESI, DRT and the recently introduced IBC and NCLT mechanisms)13. Four forms
of GoI regulation have an impact on the willingness and ability of FIs and private investors to engage the
urban finance (and especially municipal debt) market: (i) RBI regulations; (ii) Tax treatment; (iii) Insurance
and pension regulations; and (iv) SEBI listing requirements. Subsequent chapters of this report provide
observations on the key developments for these regulations and their implications on the supply of
finance for urban infrastructure.

The Lay of the Land: Recent Trends in Financing
and Funding Urban Infrastructure
This chapter provides estimates on the quantum of financing needed over the next fifteen years and the
existing and estimated financing gap, comparing needs relative to existing levels of investment. It shows
the sources of financing for capital investment on urban infrastructure and the types of agencies executing
these investments. It also describes the current state of municipal finance in India, aiming to understand
the size of the funding base for urban infrastructure by looking at fiscal performance of cities.


3.1. How much financing is needed and how large is the financing gap?
Urban capital investment needs relative to existing investment level
This section presents updated estimates of India’s urban infrastructure investment needs based on
previous estimates, and the estimated financing gap. GoI’s High-Powered Expert Committee (HPEC)
report and the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) have previously quantified India’s urban investment needs
in 2011 and 2010 respectively. Background work for this report has updated and calibrated these estimates
(see Box 2 for assumptions).

India’s cities require an estimated capital investment of USD 840 billion in urban infrastructure and
municipal services in the 15 years till 2036 (in 2020 prices), equivalent to 1.18% of estimated GDP over
this period, to address these service delivery and infrastructure gaps and keep pace with the pressures of
rapid urbanization. This is equivalent to USD 108 per capita per year over this period. This need for a sharp
increase in investments in India’s cities has already been well recognized (HPEC 2011 and MGI 2010). Urban
infrastructure and municipal services included in this estimate are urban transport (primarily mass transit
/ metro rail); core urban services such as water supply, sewerage, municipal SWM, storm water drainage,
urban roads and streetlighting; and social and community infrastructure but excludes housing and slum
upgrading.

Over half of these investment needs – almost USD 450 billion over the next 15 years – are in sectors
which can be classified as basic urban/municipal services (including water supply, sewerage, municipal
SWM, storm water drainage, urban roads and streetlighting, but excluding slum rehabilitation and public
housing). Most of the rest – around USD 300 billion - are for urban transport needs.

These future investment needs are significantly higher than current levels of capital investment in
urban infrastructure. Total capital expenditure in urban infrastructure (from all sources) was only USD
85 billion over roughly the past decade (2011-18) and averaged only 0.6% of GDP in this period. This is
well below the intermediate target of 0.84% of GDP for 2018 which was envisioned in HPEC 201114, and
exactly half the requirement of 1.18% of GDP estimated by latest projections. The volume of total capital
investment has averaged only USD 10.6 billion per year in the past decade. This is only USD 26 in per
capita terms, or four times less than the USD 108 per capita of estimated needs over the next 15 years (see
Table 4 and Table 5). This very large gap between future investment needs and current levels of capital
expenditure – an overwhelming share of which is from public fiscal resources as shown subsequently –
necessitates the need to increase revenues and mobilize substantially higher private financing to help fill
this gap.

A positive development is that capital investment in urban infrastructure has grown every year in this
period, reaching USD 16.5 billion in 2018, equivalent to USD 37 per capita or 0.68% of GDP, and averaging
USD 10.6 billion annually. Cumulative investment in this period is USD 85 billion. This is partly due to
higher allocations and fiscal transfers under GoI’s flagship programs namely Smart Cities and Atal Mission
for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) missions. In nominal per capita terms, investments
grew from USD 17 in FY 11 to USD 37 in FY 1815 (see Figure 9).

 Most of the urban capital investment in this past period has been in basic municipal services16, growing
 from USD 5.6 billion in FY 11 to USD 12.3 billion in FY 18, totaling USD 65 billion. This translates to 0.48% of
 GDP in this period, and 0.51% of GDP in FY18 which is below the HPEC target of 0.64% for this category for
 that year. On a (nominal) per capita basis, this investment grew from USD 15 to USD 28 in this period (see
 Figure 10).

 Investment in metro-rail infrastructure (urban transport) has witnessed stronger growth, from USD
 978 million in FY 11 to USD 4.1 billion in FY 18, with cumulative investments estimated at USD 20 billion
 during this period. The share of metro-rail investment in overall urban infrastructure investment went up
 from 15% in FY 11 to 25% in FY 18. Apart from the Delhi metro which led with about USD 8.5 billion addition
 to its asset block during this period, other cities including Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad added
 extensive metro-rail networks as well (see Figure 11).

The current levels of spending also appear to be well below international comparators. As a comparison,
China’s investment in urban infrastructure averaged 2.8% of GDP during the period 2000-14 according to
one estimate17 and USD 116 per capita in 2010 (MGI 2010). The World Bank has also separately estimated
that 4% of GDP needs to be invested in serving urban infrastructure needs in other countries with similar
levels of urbanization, though this includes infrastructure such as ICT infrastructure which is not included
in the scope of what is considered in this report (World Bank 2019). Another World Bank estimate from
Africa looking at broader infrastructure needs for future growth (including power and energy, urban
roads, urban information technology networks, and water and sanitation) shows that as much as one-
third of total infrastructure investment in a country in these sectors needs to be invested in urban areas
(to service urban residents and firms) to meet infrastructure needs for future economic growth.18 It is
important to caveat the comparison of India’s urban infrastructure investment profile with these other
comparators due to the variation in the types of infrastructure sectors assessed in each example and the
widely varying functional mandates of implementing agencies responsible for urban infrastructure in
each country. Despite these caveats, it appears to be the case that India’s current level of investment in
urban infrastructure as a share of its GDP is at least below benchmarks and middle-income comparators.

Box 2. Description of assumptions for estimating investment needs

     The urban investment estimates for the fifteen-year period FY 21-FY 36 has been arrived largely based
     on the framework used in the GoI High-Powered Expert Committee (HPEC) report on estimating
     investment requirements for urban infrastructure and services (HPEC 2011). The investments have
     been estimated for the same set of sectors that were covered in the HPEC report, namely, Water,
     Sewerage, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Roads and Bridges, and Urban Transport. The investments
     are estimated at 2020 prices. Population projections till 2036 are from the National Commission on
     Population’s 2019 “Report of Technical Group on population projections” which provides updated
     urban population projection.

     For basic services including water, sewerage, MSW, Roads, the Per capita Investment Cost (PCIC)
     norm used in the HPEC report was inflation adjusted for 2020 costs and applied to the population
     projections the latest Census projections to arrive at the updated investment estimate. Sewerage
     investment has been estimated at 80% of investments in water supply. In case of street lighting, the
     investment requirement has been kept at HPEC levels, given the sharp fall in LED lighting prices.

     For urban transport investment, instead of using PCIC estimates for rail and bus services, the capital
     investment has been arrived at in three parts, namely (1) Metro-rail, (2) Bus Rapid Transit System
     (BRTS) and Bus procurement and (3) Allied facilities and services.

        •	   For metro rail investment, 2500 km of metro-rail investment has been considered for the
             15-year period factoring that over 965 km is under construction and another 1000 km is
             under development and the typical development cycle of at least 7-10 years for a full cycle of
             development. The cost per km has been taken at Rs. 650 crore per km based on benchmarks
             from of Rs. 521 crore per km for Chennai Metro Rail phase II, and Mumbai metro rail at Rs. 821
             crore per km.
        •	   For bus services, the norm of 600 buses per million population has been applied to arrive at
             the total number of buses and cost per bus has been assumed at Rs. 1 crore per bus. 1000 km
             of BRTS network has been considered at Rs. 200 crore per km.
        •	   Traffic support and allied investment has been assumed at 10% of overall urban transport
             investment
     The aggregate investment needs estimate is calculated at INR 61.4 lakh crores (equivalent to about
     USD 841 bn at exchange rate of US$1=INR73), arrived based on these assumptions. If the HPEC 2011
     and MGI 2010 estimates are inflation adjusted to 2020 prices and adjusted for 15 years, they come out
     to INR 50 and 58 lakh crores respectively. The difference from the HPEC inflation adjusted estimate
     is largely on account of higher investment envisaged in Urban transport (INR 23 lakh crore instead
     of INR 8 lakh crore in HPEC report). Values in Rs. Have been converted to USD at the exchange rate
     of INR 73.


All-India trends are also mirrored in some large and highly urbanized states - including Tamil Nadu and
Gujarat - and the large cities therein.

Gujarat ULBs require total capital investment of about USD 5 billion in basic urban services per year over
the next 15 years19, equivalent to 0.83% of Gross state Domestic Product (GSDP) and 4 times the average
annual level of capital expenditure by all its ULBs over the period FY15-19. The current level of capital
expenditure on basic urban services in the state is relatively high as a share of GSDP (estimated at 1.1% of
GSDP in this period and above the estimated needs of 0.83% of GSDP) but will need to keep pace with the
expected strong growth of GSDP over the coming period. Ahmedabad city requires investment of about
USD 1.36 billion per year over the next 15 years in urban infrastructure and services (basic services and
urban transport) – equivalent to 0.22% of Gujarat GSDP per year – while its investment in FY15-19 has been


 	 The estimated capital investment requirement at state level (for Gujarat and Tamil Nadu) is for basic urban services within the mandates of
19

ULBs in each respective state. The estimate (as share of GSDP) is higher for Gujarat compared to Tamil Nadu because ULBs in Gujarat handle more
functions relative to ULBs in Tamil Nadu, including bus transport.

Tamil Nadu ULBs require total capital investment of about USD 2.8 billion in basic urban services per
year over the next 15 years, equivalent to 0.61% of GSDP20 and 3.3 times the average annual level of capital
expenditure by all its ULBs over the period FY16-20. Chennai metropolitan area requires investment
in urban infrastructure (including basic services provided by ULBs and urban transport provided by
parastatals) of about USD 2.3 billion per year over the next 15 years (equivalent to 0.4% of Tamil Nadu GSDP
over this period). This is 3.5 times more than the annual average levels of investment in these sectors in
FY16-20 (see Figure 13 for a sector-wise breakdown for Chennai).

3.2. How urban infrastructure is currently financed: Sources of financing for
capital expenditure
Box 3. Typology of commercial and non-commercial financing available to city agencies


  The following broad types of financing are available to city agencies in India (including ULBs,
  utilities and parastatals):

     •	   Fiscal transfers from higher levels of government (national and state) usually made in the
          shape of grants and non-repayable financing
     •	   Agencies’ own operating surpluses from previous years, reflecting the surplus of receipts and
          revenues over total expenditure across previous years
     •	   Various types of public and private commercial financing, including debt (municipal bonds
          and loans from scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) and various other FIs) and PPPs.
  Types of fiscal transfers: Fiscal transfers are either tied to specific expenditures (such as for specific
  projects or initiatives) or untied - in which case they form part of general revenue income of the
  agency/entity). Fiscal transfers are either from state governments (either through some sort of
  formula-based arrangements such as state Finance Commissions or revenue sharing; or in the
  shape of discretionary grant transfers), or from the national government for the purpose of specific
  national-level missions and programs (e.g. AMRUT, Smart Cities) which are either routed through
  state governments or directly transferred to city-level agencies.

  Types of debt financing: Debt financing for urban infrastructure has been accessed by ULBs and
  city agencies in two forms:

     •	   Commercial debt: Commercial debt that is tapped either as institutional loans from banks
          and FIs or through issuance of municipal bonds. This includes the following sources:
           ̵ Private commercial debt – issued on market basis:
           	
              ̵ SCBs (public sector banks, either nationalized or owned by a government agency, Indian
              	
                privately-owned banks, foreign banks licensed in India)
              ̵ Specialized infrastructure finance entities that are privately owned or have only partial
              	
                or indirect public ownership (IIFCL, IDFC, IL & FS)
              ̵ Capital markets for municipal bonds
              	
           ̵ Public commercial debt:
           	
              	
              ̵ state government FIs, who also lend to urban projects without an explicit guarantee
                by state governments. These include state Finance Corporations and FIs such as Tamil
                Nadu Urban Finance and Infrastructure Development Company (TUFIDCO), Tamil Nadu
                Urban Development Fund (TNUDF), Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development
                Finance Corporation (KUIDFC), Gujarat state Financial Services Limited (GSFS) etc.
     •	   Guaranteed lending, typically from multi-lateral agencies with a sovereign guarantee or
          loans from public FIs with state support in the form of an explicit guarantee. Such lending is
          generally not provided on commercial basis.
           ̵ Government institutions established, owned, and overseen by the public sector (e.g.
           	
             HUDCO) which generally lend on non-market basis. HUDCO loans are guaranteed by
             state governments, which transfers risk from the lender to the state government, and are
             therefore not considered to be made on market-driven basis for the purpose of this report.
           	
           ̵ Multi-lateral agencies with a sovereign guarantee, and funds usually channeled through
             state governments
  It is worth noting that the above typology may not be fully exhaustive and may not fully account for
  some types of overlap between categories in some contexts.




Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                   37
3.2.1. All-India level
Private commercial financing plays a very minor role in financing urban infrastructure in India, as
most infrastructure is financed by intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Fiscal transfers from state
governments and GoI to ULBs and parastatal agencies, especially tied grants to specific capital projects,
are the largest source of finance for investment in urban infrastructure, accounting for as much as three-
quarters of capital investment in the period FY11-18. Of this, tied fiscal transfers from state governments
are the primary source of finance, accounting for almost half of all financing for urban infrastructure in
this period.21 In fact, fiscal transfers from state governments have substantially increased over this period
(at an average annual growth rate of 19%) and are now almost twice the size of tied fiscal transfers from
GoI (see Figure 14). This increase is driven by a step-up in outlays to complement GoI schemes and launch
of state-level capital grant schemes for urban development. Growth of GoI transfers has been driven by
flagship Urban missions and metro-rail funding.

The share of ULBs’ revenue surpluses in the sources of funds used for urban infrastructure investment
has substantially declined in this period relative to other sources. It accounted for only 15% of total
capital expenditure on urban infrastructure on a “pay-as-you-go” basis in this period, halved in share of
GDP terms, and grew at a paltry 3.4% per year on average in nominal terms. As a result, growth in capital
investment has been weak as the increase in tied fiscal transfers has been largely offset by a sharp decline
in ULB-led financing (see Figure 15). HPEC 2011 had considered a reduction of the share of tied transfers
to 31% by FY 21 in favor of a higher share of expenditure from ULBs’ aggregate revenue surpluses. This
envisaged shift to higher spending by ULBs has not materialized and dependence on fiscal transfers has
grown sharply. The relative decline, and only marginal nominal increase, in contribution of ULBs own-
funds to urban capital investment over this period, when compared to the substantial increase in fiscal
transfers, appears to reflect absorptive capacity constraints to execute higher spending.

   GoI and state government transfers were estimated based on information from RBI state finances database and
GoI budgets respectively. Financing through parastatals is grouped with state outlays for the purpose of this analysis.
Commercial financing was estimated based on secondary research and includes municipal bond issuances, bank
loans and private investment in PPPs. Guaranteed loans were estimated from lending to urban infrastructure reported
by HUDCO.

Non-guaranteed commercial financing accounted for only 5% of total capital investment in urban
infrastructure in this period. This includes debt financing by ULBs (such as municipal bond issuances
and loans/borrowing from various banks and FIs) and private financing for PPPs. Commercial financing
has been roughly equally split between PPPs and commercial debt. Commercial debt, despite an increase
in issuance of municipal bonds in recent years, has financed only a paltry 2% of total capital investment in
this period. PPPs have financed 3%, of which metro rail investment was the largest sub-sector accounting
for around 70% of the total PPP volume. Loans from Housing and Urban Development Corporation Ltd
(HUDCO) have accounted for the rest of total capital expenditure at 8%. These are guaranteed by state
governments and are not considered as market based.

3.2.2. At the level of selected large and urbanized states
The financing mix for urban infrastructure in two large states, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, broadly reflects
all-India trends. At the consolidated state level, fiscal transfers from GoI and state governments financed
more than three-quarters of total ULB-level urban capital expenditure in each of these states in the last five
years. State government transfers were again dominant, financing 70% of ULB-level capital expenditure in
Tamil Nadu and 55% in Gujarat. ULB own operating surpluses contributed a relatively healthy 24% share of
total ULB capex in Gujarat, but only 9% in Tamil Nadu – which is consistent with the difference in functional

assignments of ULBs in these states. Commercial financing was negligible in Gujarat, contributing only
1% of total ULB capex state-wide. ULBs in Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, raised as much as 12% of their
total capex from commercial financing – primarily loans from state-controlled FIs (see Figure 16). However,
as shown in the subsequent chapter, this financing has had minimal private sector involvement and is
essentially public funding. There have also been no loans from HUDCO in either of these two states in this
period, likely due to the presence of state-controlled FIs.

Large cities in these two states, however, are less reliant on fiscal transfers to finance their urban
infrastructure needs. MCs in Gujarat (representing large cities) financed 35% of their capital expenditure
through their own sources in this period, with Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) financing as
much as half of its capital expenditure using its own operating surplus. In contrast, small towns in Gujarat
– governed as municipalities – have essentially fully relied on fiscal transfers and have had no other
financing source for their capital expenditure. MCs also account for the bulk of capital investment in the
state – having spent 70% of total capital expenditure on urban infrastructure in this period.

In Tamil Nadu, Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has a similar financing mix and self-reliance
as Ahmedabad in Gujarat, with a sizable operating surplus which has funded 28% of its total capital
expenditure in this period – with tied fiscal transfers accounting for only 43%. Most importantly, GCC has
also received sizable debt financing in this period from the state government and state-controlled FIs,
which have covered almost 30% of its investment needs. Subsequent chapters of this report describe
this debt financing in more detail. In contrast to GCC, other agencies providing services in the Chennai
metropolitan area (such as the water utility, selected Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) departments, and
other parastatal agencies)22 are heavily reliant on fiscal transfers.


3.2.3. Relative roles of ULBs and parastatal agencies in implementing urban infrastructure
As noted earlier, this report has primarily focused on ULBs for the analysis of municipal debt/borrowing,
as they have been primary recipients of such loans; while the analysis on PPPs has aimed to include all
PPPs regardless of type of executing agency, including ULBs, utilities, parastatals, etc. It is important to
note that agencies other than ULBs (e.g., state Departments, state-controlled special purpose vehicles,
utilities; Development Authorities etc.), are active in delivering urban infrastructure but many of these are
part of state governments, and their borrowing activities may be more accurately understood as lying in
the realm of state borrowing. Such state-level entities are referred to as parastatal agencies in this report


 	 These include: i) other ULBs in the Chennai metro area besides GCC; ii) parastatal agencies including CMWSSB,
22

CMRL, MTC and CMDA, and iii) select GoTN Departments including highways and WRD.

and include all non-ULB entities such as specialized entities for metro rail investment and operations
(e.g. Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority) and state-controlled municipal utilities (e.g.,
water and sewerage services in Chennai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad) and state-level Public Health and
Engineering Departments (PHED) (e.g. Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Punjab).

Parastatal agencies responsible for urban service delivery have a large and increasing share of capital
investment in urban infrastructure relative to ULBs. Driven by substantial investments by parastatal
agencies in metro rail infrastructure but also in basic municipal services, parastatal agencies executed just
over half (53%) of total urban capital expenditure across India in FY18, which is mostly outside the scope of
ULBs, and up from 41% in FY11 (see Figure 17). On the other hand, the share of total urban capital expenditure
executed by all ULBs nationwide (which is primarily spent on basic municipal services) fell from 59% in 2011
to under half in 2018. Note that most of the data on commercial financing trends presented in this report
do not include parastatals in scope and pertain mostly to ULBs, except for data PPPs transactions which
covers urban utilities as well. An effort has been made to present data covering all ULBs as well as city-
level agencies, including utilities and dedicated service providers/operations. However, state government
departments (such as PHED) are not included in the scope. Thus, data on total volume of commercial
financing for urban infrastructure may be under-reported in this report.

3.3. The state of municipal finance in India: Understanding the funding base
for urban infrastructure
3.3.1. Low own-source revenues coupled with rapidly increasing fiscal transfers
The overall scale of finances at the city and local level is relatively modest. Total income of all ULBs
nationwide from all sources – including untied fiscal transfers, OSR and tied fiscal transfers for specific
capital investments – remained flat at around 1% of GDP during the FY11-18 period, despite growing 13%
per annum on average in nominal terms. The report of the 15th Finance Commission (2019) notes that
urban local government income as a share of GDP is well below peer countries such as South Africa (6%
of GDP) and Brazil (7.4% of GDP), although it is important to caveat such comparisons due to the widely
varying fiscal and functional mandates of subnational and urban local governments across countries.23
Total revenue income – which includes income from untied fiscal transfers and OSR and is primarily spent
on recurrent expenditures – has been 0.70% of GDP, again below peer countries, even though it grew
somewhat in this period from 0.63% of GDP.24

Relatively slow growth and low levels of OSR undermine future funding capacity. OSR as a share of
total municipal revenue nationwide declined substantially in the FY11-18 period, from three-quarters to
two-thirds, caused by slow absolute growth in OSR (at an average annual 10%). In per capita terms, OSR
grew even slower at about 8% per annum from USD 14 to USD 23 during this period. Slow growth in OSR
also undermines the funding base for any future private financing. Total OSR of all ULBs nationwide has
grown much slower than nominal GDP growth.

In comparison, untied fiscal transfers from GoI and state governments increased substantially in
this period, growing at an average annual rate of 18%. Such untied fiscal transfers along with large and
increasing tied/conditional fiscal transfers for investments, are increasing the reliance of ULBs on this
source of financing at the expense of others, including their own revenue base and operating surpluses.
Given the limits of absorptive capacity at city agencies, this constrains total demand for financing.

Urban property tax is the largest OSR but remains miniscule relative to comparators, being only 0.15%
of GDP in aggregate nationwide. In comparison, property tax generates 0.3–0.6% of GDP for low- and
middle-income countries on average, and as much as 1.1% in OECD countries (Kelly, White and Anand
2020). In US, Canada and UK, property taxes account for 2-3% of GDP. This is despite property tax revenue
increasing at a much faster rate than other tax and non-tax sources of OSR for ULBs in this period (see
Figure 18). Total OSR was only marginally higher than aggregate revenue expenditure nationwide. Given a
concentration of OSR in large cities, this implies that a vast majority of ULBs – the ones outside a handful
metropolitan cities - are dependent on fiscal transfers to meet their revenue expenditures. While this
is not unusual compared to other countries, it shows that the potential of these smaller ULBs to raise
financing for capital needs is limited given the relatively small funding base. Policy decisions on property
valuation – specifically, valuation for property tax purposes being well below market values – as well as
policy decisions on tax rates and exemptions are a key factor contributing to low levels of revenue from
this tax.

  	 For example, electricity revenue account for the largest source of OSR for South African local governments, while
Indian ULBs do not have this mandate. Peer comparison source: reports of 15th Finance Commission (15FC 2019)

  	 This section builds on data on ULB finances in the “State of Municipal Finances in India” report prepared on behalf
of the 15th Finance Commission (15FC 2019). Being an aggregate analysis, it may not fully reflect some classification
differences at state level. For e.g., Punjab and Madhya Pradesh classify some revenue (fiscal) transfers as OSR as they
are in lieu of revenue powers that were withdrawn from ULBs.

3.3.2. Low service charges for municipal services undermining financial sustainability and viability
A noteworthy trend is the relatively slow growth in non-property tax OSR, which includes all other taxes
as well as non-tax revenues such as tariffs, service charges, fees, revenues from land sales and leases and
various instruments related to land development25. Here again, policy decisions to keep various tariffs and
fees below economic costs and levels required for financial sustainability are a key factor contributing to
low revenue from these sources.

Data collected for several large and medium-sized cities across India show that ULBs and municipal
service providing utilities are generally unable to recover the operations and maintenance (O&M)
costs, let alone capital costs, of providing municipal services such as water supply and sewerage. Data
for 14 cities (including some state-level averages) show that they recovered less than half (45%) of O&M
costs pertaining to water supply on average in recent years (see Figure 19). While some cities such as
Surat (Gujarat), Bangalore and Delhi appear to be exceptionally high performing, several other large and
medium-sized cities are only recovering one-quarter or less of their O&M costs for water supply (e.g.,
Amritsar, Ludhiana, Shimla, Kolkata and Kalaburagi (Karnataka)). Even Ahmedabad, which has relatively
strong institutional capacity is performing just at average on this indicator. Such low O&M cost recovery
rates clearly point to service charges well below the required levels for financial sustainability, and thus
undermine the viability of engaging private sector partners in service delivery and capital infrastructure
without substantial fiscal support or revision of service charges.

In fact, operating cost recovery for municipal water services by Indian utilities on average appears to be
below many comparator countries. Data from the International Benchmarking Network for Water and
Sanitation Utilities (IBNET) show that water and sewerage utilities in Indian cities recovered only 55% of
their operating costs on average, which is below the levels from utilities across a spectrum of comparator
countries. This includes large federal countries (Brazil, Mexico), large middle-income countries (Colombia,
China, Egypt, Jordan, Russia, South Africa, Vietnam) and neighboring Bangladesh (see Figure 20).

Notes: Data shown are for water supply services unless otherwise indicated as W&S (water & sewerage). This is because
cost recovery data for municipal services other than water (e.g. sewerage, SWM etc.) is generally not reliable since
there is no pattern of user charges for these services. Average is simple average for these 14.

Years of data: Ahmedabad and Surat are average from FYs 15 to 19. Chennai data are average from FYs 16 to 19. For all
others, data are for one FY only, ranging from 2017-18 to the ongoing FY based on availability.

Sources: For Ahmedabad, Surat and Chennai, data have been collected and estimated by CRISIL on behalf of World
Bank from ULB budget documents. For other cities/states, sources include state government benchmarking data
available online (Kolkata, Delhi Jal Board, Bangalore, Rajasthan, Kerala); World Bank Project Appraisal Documents for
municipal services projects (Amritsar, Ludhiana, Shimla) and consultants’ reports prepared for World Bank-financed
municipal services projects (others).

3.3.3. Weak absorptive and implementation capacity at ULBs for urban infrastructure delivery
Large ULBs across India have generally not been able to fully spend their budgeted capital expenditure
in recent years, with some large ULBs having extremely low capital budget execution rates. A review
of 10 large ULBs from across the country shows that, in total, they were able to spend only two-thirds of
their cumulative capital budget over the three FYs 2017-18 to 2019-20 (see Figure 21). For example, Jaipur
(Rajasthan), Vadodara (Gujarat), Chennai and Hyderabad were able spent only between one-third and
one-half of their respective capital budgets in this period. On the other hand, some ULBs have had very
high rates of capital budget execution (Patna, Bhopal, Coimbatore and to some extent Ahmedabad). Low
capital budget execution rates can result from several factors, including realized capital income during
the year being much lower than budgeted forecast which may be beyond ULBs’ controls, but also weak
absorptive capacity which prevents full implementation of budgeted and approved capital expenditure
during the year.

Slow implementation performance by states and ULBs on several recent flagship GoI Urban Missions
further points to constraints on implementation capacity at the city level. Data are available for the
following GoI missions: i) Smart Cities Mission (SCM); ii) AMRUT; iii) Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM, or Clean
India Mission); and iv) Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY, Prime Minister’s Housing Scheme). Data show
that ULBs across India have so far executed only about one-fifth of the cumulative cost/outlay of approved
projects under SCM and AMRUT over the last six FYs (from FY2015-16 to FY2020-21). The total cost of projects
approved under these missions is USD 27 billion and USD 10 billion for SCM and AMRUT respectively, of
which ULBs have been able to execute only 22% (SCM) and 18% (AMRUT) respectively so far.26

Given this low execution rate, GoI has not fully transferred/released its committed contribution to these
projects to states/ULBs. Cumulative transfers by GoI to states/ULBs over this period have been only half
of their committed contribution for both SCM and PMAY. GoI transfers under AMRUT and SBM have been
higher (84% and 76% respectively) as a share of the committed contribution over this period. (see Figure
22) Under most of these programs only the first release is made upfront by GoI while subsequent releases
to states/ULBs are contingent on implementation progress at the project level which has clearly lagged.




 	 Data as of March 2021. GoI data for SCM and AMRUT show total expenditure by ULBs on Mission project across
26

all financing sources (GoI funds, state funds, own share etc.) which allows calculation of total execution rate. It is
not possible to provide comparable figures for PMAY and SBM. In case of PMAY, available figures show utilization/
expenditure by ULBs only against the GOI contribution released, not the total expenditure by ULBs for these projects/
Mission across all financing sources. Utilization/expenditure data for SBM not available.

This low implementation capacity in the context of increasing tied fiscal transfers to ULBs is resulting
in budget surpluses which are not being used to finance capex. As shown earlier, the share of total urban
capital expenditure coming from ULBs’ own surpluses has halved in the last decade and its nominal value
has grown only marginally. This is despite a steady increase in the aggregate size of operating surpluses
in this period. ULBs’ inability to invest their excess surplus points to constrained capacity for capital
expenditure (see Figure 23 for relative increase in operating surplus).

Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                                  47
However, the gap between future investment needs and current levels of capital expenditure is so
large that, once these absorptive capacity constraints begin to resolve, the existing high levels of public
fiscal resources will clearly not be sufficient to address the needs. This will necessitate the need to mobilize
substantially higher private commercial financing to help fill this gap.

3.3.4. Concentration of fiscal base in metropolitan cities and selected states
The existing funding base to leverage higher private financing is concentrated in a few states and large/
metropolitan cities within them. Just five states (namely Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,
and Tamil Nadu) – with 40% of the country’s urban population - accounted for three-quarters of total OSR
and two-thirds of total revenue income of all ULBs nationwide in the last decade. Of these five states, four (all
above excluding Madhya Pradesh) account for 36% of the country’s urban population, 58% of total revenue
of all ULBs nationwide and 68% of total OSR in FY18 (see Table 6). MCs, being the ULBs in large/metropolitan
cities, accounted for 82% of total OSR and 80% of the revenue surplus nationwide across all ULBs in FY18 (see
Figure 24). MCs in just these four states (i.e., Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu) accounted
for 44% of total revenue receipts and 61% of total OSR across all ULBs nationwide in FY18. Across all MCs
nationwide, those in these four states accounted for as much as two-thirds of total revenue receipts and
three-quarters of total OSR in FY18 (see Table 6).

There are also important variations in municipal finance indicators across these four large states.
Gujarat and Maharashtra collect higher OSR per capita relative to the national average whereas Tamil Nadu
and Karnataka are below the average, pointing to the potential to improve OSR performance specifically
in these two large and urbanized states. Karnataka also underspends on urban capital expenditure per
capita relatively to the other 3 states which spend higher than the national average. On the other hand,
despite their relatively low revenues, Tamil Nadu ULBs spend as much as half of their revenue on capital
investment to address infrastructure gaps – well above the national average – while the other 3 of these
states have a substantial portion of their revenues consumed by recurrent expenditure (see Table 7).

3.3.5. Potential impact of Covid-19 pandemic on municipal finances
A look at three cases in India, namely, Chennai, Ahmedabad, and Surat (Gujarat), shows substantially
variation in municipal finances since the onset of the pandemic. Ahmedabad and Chennai saw revenues
increase immediately after the pandemic due to higher fiscal transfers support from national and state
governments’, while Surat saw a drop in revenues in the first year of the pandemic. Current revenues
increased 20% in Chennai in FY21 compared to FY20 (with the state government provided higher fiscal
transfers to support the city in responding to the large number of COVID-19 cases) and 12% in Ahmedabad
in this period, with increases in both OSR and fiscal transfers (the latter due to a higher health grant
for pandemic management as well as grants related to state elections). In contrast, Surat saw a decline
in current revenue of 18% in the first year of the pandemic. Ahmedabad and Surat are expected to see
increasing trends in revenue in FY22, with their current revenues estimated to increase by 14% and 31%
respectively over the preceding FY. In contrast, Chennai is estimated to see an 8% decline in current
revenue in FY22 from the preceding FY, mainly because of the state government’s downward adjustment
of fiscal transfers from the record high in the previous year.27

Chennai and Surat experienced sharp in OSR by 15% and 22% respectively in the first year of the pandemic,
partly due to the tax forgiveness program and deep economic contraction due to the high number of
COVID cases (in Chennai especially), with property tax revenue declining by almost half in Chennai and a
quarter in Surat. Ahmedabad, in contrast, saw a remarkable increase in OSR of 23% in that year, driven by
a substantial property tax collection effort in early 2021. Surat is also estimated to see a sizable recovery
in OSR in FY22, when property tax collection is estimated to return to pre‐COVID levels.28 Thus, there is
significant uncertainty on the medium-term impact of the pandemic on revenues.

The State of Private Financing for Urban
Infrastructure in India: Debt and PPPs
4.1. The mirage of municipal debt financing: Trends and observations
4.1.1. Trends in Debt financing
Debt financing on a private commercial basis, not guaranteed by state governments (in which case it
would really be state financing), is estimated to have accounted for only about 2% of capital expenditure
on urban infrastructure made by ULBs and parastatals nationwide in the period FY11 to 18, amounting
to about USD 2.0 billion. This includes debt from two sources, namely borrowing from public and private
FIs and proceeds from municipal bonds. Total annual issuances of commercial debt financing for ULBs,
including loans and bonds, was muted in this period, and ranged between USD 156–311 million of annual
issuances. In comparison, loans from HUDCO, guaranteed by state governments, have accounted for a
much larger share of capital expenditure in this period, being 8% or USD 6.4 billion of expenditure. In fact,
the volume of loan issuances from HUDCO to ULBs grew every year in this period, from USD 585 million
in 2011 to USD 1.6 billion in 2018.

The share of municipal bonds is very small in relation to commercial loans, being less than one-tenth of
total commercial debt raised by ULBs in the last decade. Over 90% of commercial debt financing raised
by ULBs has been through loans from scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) and other FIs in this period,
being around USD 1.9 billion. Municipal bond issues have raised USD 141 million in this period, of which
80% percent were issued only during FY 17 and FY 18 (see Figure 25).

The market for municipal bonds in particular, and municipal debt in general, is extremely small in
India relative to state-level borrowing and other countries. The total value of outstanding debt issued
under municipal bonds in India is estimated to be less than two-thousandth of the total outstanding state

Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                      51
government debt (state Development Loans (SDL)) in 2019. Outstanding municipal bond debt in South
Africa, which has a well-developed and thriving municipal bond market, is over 6 times higher in value
than the outstanding municipal bond debt in India.29 However, South African municipal bonds constitute
a relatively much higher share of the total debt securities market in the country compared to Indian
municipal bonds, pointing to the relative maturity of the South African municipal bond market. These ratios
improve slightly when considering total municipal debt, including commercial loans and non-commercial
guaranteed loans. Total Indian municipal debt outstanding is estimated to be about 0.3% of GDP, 0.5% of the
total outstanding debt securities market of India, and 1/50th of total outstanding state government debt.

The comparison with state governments also reflects the substantial amount of debt raised by states,
which makes India one of the world’s largest markets for subnational debt. Total outstanding state
Government debt securities have been previously estimated to be around 15% of GDP and a quarter of
the total debt securities market in India. As a share of GDP, state-level debt in India is equivalent to the
total outstanding municipal bond market in the United states, which is also estimated to be 15% of GDP,
and includes in “municipal bonds” debt from state and local governments, urban infrastructure authorities
and several other subnational/local entities. This is more than 10 times the level of outstanding municipal/
subnational debt (as share of GDP) in South Africa. State debt is clearly the most significant subnational
phenomenon in India, with municipal debt being miniscule in comparison. This has implications for
growing the municipal debt market: to the extent that municipal and state debt may rely primarily on
certain overlapping underlying economic bases for repayment, there may be a limit as to how much the
municipal debt market for any given state’s ULBs could be expanded without a concomitant reduction in
the state’s own long-term debt. However, given the very low levels of municipal debt currently, such limits
are far off. Further, given the increasing role of state-controlled agencies (parastatals, departments, etc.) in
delivering urban infrastructure as shown previously, these state governments agencies will be candidates
for raising commercial financing. However, the scope of this report does not include an assessment of debt
and other private financing at the state government level, beyond the recent use of PPP transactions for
certain urban infrastructure projects.

Private debt financing has primarily been raised by a few large ULBs across the country. Cities from
only 7 states have accounted for all municipal bond issuances in India till date, with five states, namely
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh contributing more than two-thirds of
value of issuance. Only a handful of large cities (Chennai, Bangalore, Indore, Pune, Nagpur, and Vijayawada)
have accessed institutional/bank loans. There has been an increase in municipal bond issuance in the last
few years, with a concerted push by GoI starting with the issuance of credit ratings of ULBs in 500 cities
under the AMRUT mission – where only 35 cities were rated A- and above (28 of which are large cities),
fiscal incentives for ULBs for bond issuance, and issuance of SEBI regulations for listing of municipal debt
securities on financial exchanges. Despite these initiatives, only five cities have issued bonds in the last 4
years. There has been a total of only 30 municipal bond issuances in India, starting from the mid-1990s,
which have raised a total of USD 380 million (see Figure 26). The recent issuances have had the following
key aspects:

     •	   Structured issuance with good credit ratings: India’s bond market is heavily skewed towards higher
          rated papers. Pune and Ahmedabad municipal bond issues were backed by AA+ ratings, while
          Bhopal and Indore issues received AA credit rating. Hyderabad raised the highest volume but had a
          AA- credit rating.
     •	   Coupon rates and tenor: All issues except Ahmedabad had a 10-year tenor. The coupon rates reflect
          the credit rating strength of each city/ULB.
     •	   Financial covenants and credit enhancement: Financial covenants related to escrow accounts
          and debt service coverage ratios were part of the financial instrument structure. All issues required
          creation of escrow accounts for interest payment, debt service reserves and sinking funds, and well-
          defined mechanisms for their operation.
     •	   Private placement: All bonds were sold through private placement and listed in National Stock
          Exchange of India / Bombay Stock Exchange.

A high reliance on guaranteed lending reflects difficulties in authentic debt issuance which is secured
by revenue streams of the issuing entity. Institutional/bank loans on market basis have been tapped
by a few large cites mainly from SCBs. Loan sizes have ranged between USD 28 million (Pune) and 134
million (Bengaluru) and loan tenors have ranged between 3 and 15 years. Escrow of property taxes and
other receivables is the most common payment security mechanism. Hypothecation of assets (such as
commercial properties, land, hospitals etc.) has been seen in a few larger size loans but does not appear
to be a necessary requirement.

The volume of “commercial debt financing” shown above does not reflect true private financing on
market basis as it also includes loans from state government-controlled FIs which lend public funds
and contribute a substantial share of debt financing for cities. The case of Tamil Nadu is illustrative:
loans made by GoTN-owned FIs (namely Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) & Tamil Nadu
Urban Finance and Infrastructure Development Company (TUFIDCO))30 accounted for majority of all
debt accessed by Tamil Nadu cities in the last five years (82% of debt of all Tamil Nadu ULBs and 71%
of debt by Chennai city agencies). The size of these loans from TNUDF and TUFIDCO is substantial for
Chennai: they accounted for one-fifth of all capital investment made by GCC in the past five years. Private
commercial debt was accessed only through two transactions during this period, namely a pooled bond
issuance under the Water and Sanitation Pooled Fund trust (WSPF) and a SCB loan for GCC. In all, private
commercial debt was marginal at around 2% share of total capital investment by Tamil Nadu ULBs and
Chennai city agencies (see Table 8).

These loans cannot really be considered to have been made to ULBs on a private commercial market
basis. First, existing financing raised and utilized by TNUDF is solely from loans from international
multilateral and bilateral development finance institutions which are channeled through GoTN. These
loans are guaranteed by the sovereign and taken by the state government as part of their overall liabilities,
and then passed on to TNUDF. TNUDF has raised funds from financial markets only once, more than
twenty years ago in 2000. Thus, TNUDF financing is essentially multilateral lending to cities, channeled
through state governments and the FI, guaranteed by a higher level of government. Second, most
investment projects financed by TNUDF are supplemented by grant funding by the state (as part of the
same arrangements which operate TNUDF), reducing the effective cost of project financing for ULBs to
below the cost of financing paid by TNUDF (see Box 4). Third, a substantial share of financing provided
by TUFIDCO to city agencies (70% in the last five years) is also subsidized below the cost of financing as
concessional loans, as it mostly includes revolving grants, own funds, and ring-fenced programs of the
state and national governments. In sum, financing from TNUDF and TUFIDCO is not really market driven
and involves practically no gearing from the private sector.

Box 4. TNUDF – creating a market for urban infrastructure finance or recycling public funds?


     TNUDF was set up in as a Trust in 1996 under the Indian Trust Act 1882 by Government of Tamil
     Nadu(GoTN), with Trust Unit capital / equity contributions by GoTN and three large FIs (ICICI, IL&FS
     and HDFC). It was setup as the first entity in the country providing long-term finance for urban and
     civic infrastructure on a non-guarantee mode. It is managed by a Corporate Trustee – Tamil Nadu
     Urban Infrastructure Company Ltd. (TNUICL) which is managed by a Board of Directors nominated
     by GoTN and the other three unitholders. TNUDF is operated by Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure
     Financial Services Ltd. (TNUIFSL) as its fund manager.

     Funds raised from market: Till date, TNUDF has raised funds from the financial market only once in
     2000. This was done to meet a covenant of the World Bank under a Bank-supported financing project
     (TNUDP-III). This is the only market issuance / borrowing by TNUDF. Its liability side is otherwise fully
     met by guaranteed financing (lines of credit) from multilateral development finance institutions
     (World Bank, ADB, KfW and JICA), which flows through GoTN.

     Cost of borrowing: GoTN passes these funds from multilaterals at a rate pegged to 10-year
     government securities. TNUDF makes a margin by charging a higher interest rate to ULBs in its on-
     lending relative to the interest rate it pays on its borrowing / liabilities.

     Process of fund flow between GoTN and TNUDF: GoTN passes the raised multilateral funds to ULBs
     / city agencies in two parts – a borrowing component which flows to TNUDF and a grant component
     which goes to a grant fund called Project Sustainability Grant Fund (PSGF) also managed by TNUIFSL.
     This allows TNUIFSL to fund projects in a blended manner with grants from PSGF and loans from
     TNUDF. The loans from TNUDF are priced close to market interest rates. However, most projects
     financed through this arrangement also get a capital grant from PSGF, typically between 30% to
     50% of project cost based on loan appraisal by TNUIFSL, which is non-returnable and interest-free.
     Effective cost of project financing to ULB is therefore lower than the interest paid on TNUDF loans.



4.1.2. Observations on Debt financing
Notwithstanding the highly constrained financing volumes outlined above it is important to note
that the current level of debt financing in many large metropolitan cities is well below their existing
debt servicing potential. It is estimated that 27 of the largest ULBs (excluding Mumbai) which received
an investment grade credit rating under AMRUT can currently borrow and service an additional USD
7.7 to 8.4 billion in debt based on their prevailing financial indicators (see Figure 27 for a set of large
cities). This is more than 20 times their existing level of debt stock, which was USD 352 million as of FY18.
Mumbai alone can currently borrow an additional USD 5 billion given its current estimated debt servicing
capacity.31 It is worth noting that this potential is certainly limited relative to total investment needs – for
instance, this additional debt carrying potential for AMC is one-quarter of its total estimated investment
needs for the next five years, while for GCC it is only 13% of its annual estimated investment needs over the
next five years. This demonstrates that these cities, too, are subject to the broader fiscal and institutional
realities of all ULBs in India. However, it is nonetheless significant relative to the existing low levels of
commercial financing. These cities account for a fifth of India’s urban population. This presents fertile
ground for targeted incremental action, both to make a difference in these cities themselves and for its
wider demonstration effects.




 	Estimates are based on existing operating surpluses of ULBs to fund debt servicing costs using conservative
31

assumptions on business-as-usual growth over the next 10 years. It is assumed that operating surpluses will increase
by 8% per annum over 10 years (which is conservative relative to 10% average annual increase in 2011-18), and that 50%
of these surpluses will be available for debt service costs. Debt potential is calculated as the NPV of these surpluses over
10 years with 10% discount rate.

In this regard, it should be noted that the existing narrow and non-buoyant OSR base impairs the total
future debt carrying capacity of ULBs and presents a binding constraint to expand private financing
even in larger cities. In Tamil Nadu for example, growth in revenue income (and OSR) of state-wide ULBs
and Chennai agencies has substantially lagged growth in revenue expenditure, resulting in declining
operating surpluses and limiting the potential debt servicing capacity. Estimates of Tamil Nadu ULBs
show that if OSR continues to grow at the existing slow pace of, say, 5% over the next 15 years, ULBs will
be able to fund only an additional USD 2 billion of capex from own sources or commercial financing –
equivalent to a marginal 4% of the investment volumes needed over this period. This implies that they will
need to rely on fiscal transfers for additional investment if OSR do not increase substantially. In Gujarat,
despite an empowered local government framework with strong devolution of functional responsibilities
to ULBs, property tax revenue for AMC grew at a relatively slow pace of 4% per annum on average between
FY15 to FY20, while current expenditure outpaced income. This resulted in a decline in operating surplus
which has reduced the ability to borrow by decreasing funding available to repay debt and interest.

state governments generally control most substantial aspects of commercial financing and investment
decisions by ULBs and city agencies. They approve transactions on a case-by-case basis, with ULBs
undertaking all commercial financing transactions (borrowing or PPPs) with approval from the state.
State governments also have a strong and centralized role in approval and appraisal of projects and capital
investment needs. In Tamil Nadu, delegation of powers to ULBs for decisions involving capital expenditure
is low relative to the scale of investment even in larger cities. This centralization of capex decision-making
is reflected in the high share of tied fiscal transfers from state governments in capital expenditure, as well
as the large share of GoTN-controlled FIs in ULB debt financing, as shown in the preceding discussion. The
two states where this factor is less salient are Gujarat and Maharashtra, where ULBs have higher decision-
making remits over spending from own source revenue and untied grants - but not for tied funds which
are provided by the state for specific projects.

Even in more devolved states like Gujarat the scale of borrowing is very low. The quantum of borrowing
by Gujarat MCs in large cities has been only 1.3% of their total capex in the last 5 years, which is very small
given the context of strong devolution of functional and financial powers (see Table 9). Municipal bonds
have been largely in the form of one-off issuances by AMC. AMC did not issue any municipal bonds for


56                                                                Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
twelve years prior to 2018. Lending from other windows including Gujarat state Financial Services Limited
(GSFS) and the Shri Nidhi scheme is not truly market based, as it is provided at a discount to market
financing and does not present scalable options to expand municipal borrowing or gear in financing from
the private sector. This is similar to the case of TNUDF and TUFIDCO discussed in the preceding chapter.

A limited amount of credit is extended based on true credit risk taken by the lender/investor on the
credit quality of the borrowing ULB. Bond issuances have been occasional and sporadic and represent
negotiated agreements between the state and the city. Overall, notwithstanding an uptick in debt
financing in 2016-2019, the current situation is far from the development of a privately financed municipal
debt market, with occasional transactions being entered into among a small group of city agencies.


4.2. The unfulfilled promise of PPPs in urban infrastructure: trends and
observations
This chapter looks at trends and the potential of PPPs as a means of financing urban infrastructure needs
in India. This financing could be in (1) greenfield projects, involving financing, construction, management,
and transfers of assets (e.g., water treatment plants, processing facility for municipal solid waste (MSW)),
and (2) brownfield projects involving financing, rehabilitation, management, and transfer of existing
assets handed over to private partner (e.g., upgradation of distribution network to 24x7 supply).


4.2.1. Trends in PPPs
PPP transactions for urban infrastructure in India have seen a marked decline in the last decade both
in monetary value and transaction volume. 134 PPP projects have been awarded in the urban sector
since 2000, having a total cost of USD 5.5 billion. PPP project awards have declined substantially after a
brief but substantial spike between 2007 and 2012, where most of these projects were awarded. Only one-
third of all PPP investments awarded since 2000 came in the last decade – including 55 projects worth
USD 1.7 billion (see Figure 28).

 Sectoral and institutional distribution: MSW projects had the highest share (by volume and value) of
 project awards in the last decade, followed by water and waste-water projects. ULBs accounted for almost
 two-thirds of PPPs by value in the last decade, with the rest being awarded by parastatals. All metro rail
 projects have been executed by parastatal agencies while all MSW projects have been executed by ULBs.
 Water and wastewater projects are split between ULBs and parastatals (see Table 10).

Geographic concentration in Maharashtra and other large states: As in OSR performance and debt
financing, the same 5 states (Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu) accounted
for almost three-quarters of PPP transaction value and two thirds of volume in the last decade, with
Maharashtra alone accounting for almost half of them by monetary value. These five states will likely be
the key drivers of any momentum in private financing for urban infrastructure, given their concentration
of funding base (OSR performance and potential), relatively sophisticated urban institutional frameworks
and high rates of economic activity and urbanization.

However, in several of these states recent trends in PPPs are not promising. Despite a long history with
urban sector PPPs, Tamil Nadu has seen new project starts shrink since 2010, with only 2 projects awarded
in the last 10 years, and previously awarded ones facing substantial legal, operational and sustainability
issues. In Gujarat, the level of private financing in basic urban services has been very modest with most
PPPs being simple O&M outsourcing contracts or implemented with sizable fiscal support.

PPPs in urban infrastructure have needed sizable funding support, in the shape of capital grants from
state governments and GoI. PPP projects in MSW in Hyderabad and Coimbatore under GoI’s Jawaharlal
Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme received grant funding of 35% and 70% of
project cost respectively, while metro-rail projects in Mumbai and Hyderabad received viability gap
financing support of 27% and 10% of project cost respectively. Water distribution projects were financed
with 90% public funds in Khandwa and Shivpuri, and 70% in Nagpur with grant from GoI’s JNNURM
scheme. The share of private financing in PPP project costs has generally varied between 40% and 70%
of project cost, while some recent PPP contracts (e.g., Coimbatore and Malviya Nagar) have only 20%-30%
of private financing. City agencies have been unable to expand the resource and funding base to support
private financing as user charges in urban services viz., water supply, sewerage networks, and bus services
rarely recover even O&M costs. PPP investments have therefore needed sizable viability gap funding and/
or availability payments that are largely met either from intergovernmental fiscal transfers or general tax
revenues at the national, state, or local levels.


4.2.2. Observations on PPPs
The low prevalence of PPP transactions for urban infrastructure can be attributed to the following inter-
related factors.

PPP projects rely on availability payments or viability funding for bankability. This is due to low user
fees, weak recurrent revenue performance and the absence of project-specific revenues based on true
economic cost. Project-specific revenues (i.e., revenue streams specifically tied to, and deriving from, a
particular infrastructure project) in India’s urban sector are insufficient to support returns on investment
in full. For instance, user charges, tariffs, and fees in several sectors (such as municipal SWM, water &
wastewater services etc.) do not even cover O&M costs and are not reflective of the economic and financial
costs of service provision. Most PPPs needed sizable upfront and continued fiscal support in the form of
availability payments and viability gap financing, with the share of user charges in the funding base being
relatively minor (Table 11 from Tamil Nadu illustrates the point). The fiscal gaps have been exacerbated
over time due to the lack of, or slow, growth of project-specific revenues and a very weak regime for tariffs
and user charges, which has undermined the continued viability of PPP projects. Without drastic changes
to reflect higher levels of cost recovery, PPP projects will continue to require availability payments or fiscal
support.

Along with viability and funding gaps, the design of urban infrastructure PPPs has not adequately
accounted for risk-sharing and risk-transfer mechanisms for project risks. As a result, several urban
infrastructure PPPs in Tamil Nadu since 2000 have faced operational issues due to unanticipated demand
shocks and various technical and legal challenges, with some needing to be restructured and coming
into public ownership. Commitments which were made by state governments and ULBs at the time of
transaction awards to revise fee structures and align them with cost recovery principles have not materialized.
Projects which have had revenue models dependent on user charges and transfer of demand risk to private
investor have faltered. For example, water supply concessions in the cities of Tiruppur (Tamil Nadu) and
Haldia (West Bengal) struggled when demand risks transferred to the private concessionaire unraveled
and public entities took over operations of the project’s special purpose vehicle to keep it operational, while
projects in the cities of Khandwa and Shivpuri (both Madhya Pradesh) faced user resistance owing to tariff
increases. In some recent PPPs, including in Coimbatore (Tamil Nadu) and Malviya Nagar (Delhi), demand
and tariff risks have been largely retained by the public authority.

Given these fiscal gaps and persistently weak OSR performance of most large ULBs and parastatal
agencies nationwide, PPPs are currently subsidized by inter-governmental fiscal transfers, the local
recurrent revenue base, and other sources of budgetary surplus, which are also the funding source for
municipal borrowing. ULBs thus face an implicit tradeoff between debt/borrowing and PPPs as two
sources of private commercial financing – given the common funding base for both types of financing
they effectively compete with one another. The low funding and resource base limits the utility of PPPs as
a financing instrument based on available budgetary surpluses. Weak financial positions of ULBs and city
agencies thus appears to be a key binding constraint. Finally, these entities have extremely low capacity
to design and structure complex PPP transactions with sophisticated risk-sharing mechanisms and deal
with private investors.

To overcome some of these challenges and mobilize private investment, GoI has recently supported
the development of certain municipal infrastructure on a hybrid annuity model. GoI is supporting the
development of Sewage Treatment Plants in large cities along the Ganges river on this model under its
National Mission for Clean Ganga, with plants in three cities (Varanasi, Mathura (both Uttar Pradesh) and
Haridwar (Uttarakhand)) having been awarded. The contract is for 15 years entered between state-level
water utilities and private operators to design, construct and operate these plans, with 40% of capex funded


60                                                                        Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
upfront by the government and the remaining 60% to be paid over the life of the project as a performance-
linked annuity secured through intercept mechanisms at the central government level to provide revenue
security to the private sector. However, while the model has significant potential for being used in many
cities to improve operational efficiencies, it does not address the core financial and institutional constraints
which hinder the long-term scalability of PPP transactions. By relying on a recurrent annuity payment, the
model essentially transfers the payment responsibility on to the implementing agency’s income statement,
to be paid from its general revenue sources. These annuity payments can thus cannibalize debt service
capacity and funding capacity for other sources of financing.

The potential for increased PPP transactions in urban infrastructure will remain limited unless
substantial reforms are undertaken to improve the funding base. Even in “attributable” urban services
where the end-user/beneficiary is distinctly identifiable and can be charged for the service, PPP potential
is constrained by the existing revenue structure (i.e. low cost recovery) for these services as well as varying
affordability and access levels among beneficiary groups, which undermines the viability of PPP projects
for private investors and requires fiscal support to overcome these risks. Such “attributable” services
that are generally within the mandate of ULBs and/or parastatal city agencies in India include the
following: MSW (processing, landfill facility management, collection, and transfer contracts); water supply
(distribution); water and wastewater treatment; transport facilities (bus terminals, parking); urban roads
and bridges; and selected public transport services such as bus operations (where parastatal agencies
tend to have a larger role). The existing regime undermines viability of PPP transactions without the
presence of availability payments and other forms of fiscal support which shift project costs and risks to
the public sector.

The low levels of local revenue exacerbate the situation by reducing the fiscal capacity of ULBs and
parastatal city agencies to fund these availability payments, thus requiring additional interventions from
state governments. ULBs and parastatal city agencies may not have enough operating surpluses and fiscal
balances at current levels to support these payments. The regular involvement of state governments to
resolve issues with PPP transactions, or to restructure them, is thus not surprising. Finally, the potential for
PPP financing is even lower in other major municipal services which are considered “non-attributable”,
such as storm water drainage networks, where the end-user/beneficiary is not distinctly identifiable, and
the service benefits extend to the entire community. Such services are typically financed through general
revenues and fiscal resources rather than project-specific revenue streams. They also constitute a large
share of infrastructure investments and needs in any given city. For these reasons these services are not
strong candidates for PPP transactions.


4.3. Clustering states and cities to determine private financing potential
Given the heterogeneity of the urban financing landscape among states, it is useful to categorize
the large states and cities within them to establish a basis for prioritizing them for enabling private
financing. There are 11 states in India which each have urban population greater than 15 million, collectively
hold three-quarters of the country’s total estimated urban population and 90% of the country’s total ULB
revenues and OSR. These 11 states can be further divided into the following clusters:

   1.	 Cluster 1 – Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu. These states account for 36% of national
       urban population, 58% of the country’s total ULB revenue, and two-third of total OSR. They have
       high levels of urbanization, GSDP per capita, and local revenue and expenditure in per capita terms.
       They also have higher levels of devolution and fiscal transfers relative to other states. Cities in these
       four states are relatively better placed to access private financing.
   2.	 Cluster 2 – Andhra Pradesh (AP), Kerala, Rajasthan, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Uttar Pradesh
       (UP), West Bengal (WB). These states account for 40% of national urban population, one-third of
       the country’s total ULB revenue, and a quarter of total OSR. Cities in these states have low OSR per
       capita relative to Cluster 1 barring Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh; and low GSDP per capita
       barring Kerala and West Bengal, which will make it somewhat challenging for cities in these states
       to tap private capital financing.
   3.	 All other states can be considered as Cluster 3, which while accounting for nearly a quarter of
       national urban population have only about one-tenth of the country’s total ULB revenue and OSR.


Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                 61
Combining these state clusters with the typology of cities discussed earlier enables the categorization
of each city based on its potential for accessing private financing. This typology includes large/
metropolitan cities governed by MCs; and smaller cities having other types of governing bodies (such as
municipalities and Town Panchayats). Credit ratings of 500+ ULBs conducted under the AMRUT program
are also factored in to determine their categorization of MCs. The following categorization of cities is
proposed based on these factors:

     •	   “High potential” cities include all MCs in Cluster 1 states and those MCs in Cluster 2 and 3 states
          having A- and above credit rating. This is a total of 71 cities covering an estimated 29% of the total
          national urban population.
     •	   Within this group of “high potential” cities, there is a further subset where the existing potential
          has already been demonstrated. 28 MCs nationwide received an investment grade credit rating
          of A- under AMRUT and should be the primary focus of early policy action. These 28 cities cover an
          estimated 18% of the total national urban population (see Table 12).
     •	   “Medium potential” cities include all MCs in Cluster 2 states other than those rated A- and above,
          and all municipalities in Cluster 1 states. This set of cities covers an estimated 19% of the total national
          urban population.
     •	   “Low potential” cities include all other cities not included in High and medium potential and cover
          52% of the total national urban population.
Past private financing transactions confirm the basis for this clustering approach. Cities from states in
Clusters 1 and 2 have accounted for almost all debt issues by value in India, and 83% of the value of urban
infrastructure PPP projects. The remainder of the national urban population can be considered as “low
potential” cities from the perspective of accessing private finance. This primarily include municipalities in
Cluster 2 states and other ULBs such as Town Panchayats etc.

This categorization shows the challenge of scaling private financing in India. Cities that are classified
as having high potential house only about a fifth of the urban population. Even these high potential
cities with intrinsic potential (along with capacity and creditworthiness) to scale private financing are not
currently accessing any such financing in a material quantum. The following chapter aims to understand
the key factors impacting this dilemma.

Analysis of Key Factors Impacting Private
Commercial Financing for Urban Infrastructure
This chapter uses the conceptual framework described in Chapter 2 to explain the key factors impacting
the demand for, and supply of, private financing for urban infrastructure in India. It shows that while
the enabling environment for private financing has improved substantially at the national level in the
last decade, the low demand for financing is a fundamental constraint and is also heavily influenced by
state-level regulatory factors which prohibit this demand from materializing. Each of the key factors are
assessed below, following by a summary assessment.


5.1. Factors impacting demand for private financing
5.1.1. Policy and political economy factors impacting revenue levels and funding base for private
financing
The persistent general policy orientation across ULBs and the state level to tax and charge for urban
infrastructure and services at rates well below those required to cover the costs of providing such
services is a key constraint on the ability to raise more commercial financing. This limits the level of funding
available to cover the costs of commercial financing, and thus places an indirect cap on the volume of
commercial financing that can be raised. In other words, the commercial financing constraint basically
reflects a funding constraint. This true across all types of ULB and parastatal agencies providing urban
services. Earlier chapters have shown that urban property tax revenue is very low relative to comparators,
being only 0.15% of GDP compared to 0.3–0.6% of GDP on average for low- and middle-income countries;
while several large cities are recovering less than half the O&M costs of providing certain municipal
services, which is well below many comparator middle income countries. Weak OSR performance is a
constraint on demand as it impairs the ability of ULBs and city agencies to service higher debt and PPPs.
The level of recurrent revenue determines the volume of debt that can be raised and the viability of PPP
transactions for ULBs. Without a reformed OSR structure for taxes and fees, many PPP projects – even in
sectors and services where cost recovery is possible – will face viability concerns.

In many cases ULBs are not fully utilizing the scope and potential of local OSR assigned to them, due
to this general policy orientation. The typical set of revenue assignments to ULBs by states in India is not
much different from, or weaker than, other countries at similar levels of income. In most states, property
taxes are assigned to ULBs along with the ability to levy service charges for those municipal services which
are functionally assigned to them (e.g., MSW, water & sanitation etc.), although the latter is limited by
variation in functional/expenditure assignments across states. In several states some municipal services
are not devolved to ULBs and are instead provided by state-controlled entities. While most states provide
substantial direction to ULBs on the base, scope, and levels of OSR assigned to ULBs (i.e., property taxes
and service charges for devolved services), such direction is often at the level of determining the overall
parameters of these revenues. This includes setting upper limits on property tax rates and allowing ULBs
to set specific rates within these limits. ULBs, however, invariably set rates well below these authorized
limits or establish service charge structures which below optimal levels. This occurs even in large ULBs
including Ahmedabad and Chennai.

Until ULB revenues perform at higher levels, and fiscal transfers are sufficient and structured in such
a way as to provide sufficient funding to pay for commercial financing, such financing will be highly
constrained and can only be raised in proportion to funding performance, which is relatively low currently.
Previous chapters have also shown that this is the case even for the bigger and better performing cities,
as even these cities will be able to leverage limited incremental private financing, relative to investment
needs, even if they were to maximize their current borrowing potential.




Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                 63
5.1.2. Low absorptive capacity, driven by weaknesses in urban institutional capacity
Weak absorptive capacity at implementing agencies systematically hinders higher infrastructure
investment overall, regardless of source of funds, as shown in previous chapters. Previous chapters
show that large ULBs across India have generally not been able to fully spend their budgeted capital
expenditure in recent years, with some large ULBs having extremely low capital budget execution rates.
Further, slow implementation performance by states and ULBs on several recent flagship GoI Urban
Missions has pointed to constraints on implementation capacity at the city level, with ULBs having so far
executed only 22% and 18% for SCM and AMRUT respectively and transfers by GoI to ULBs being only half
of their committed contribution for both SCM and PMAY. Slow implementation progress coupled with
increasing leftover aggregate budget surpluses indicates capacity limitations at implementing agencies
which constrain the absorption of additional financial resources regardless of source.

This is the case even in large cities with higher creditworthiness, larger economic and revenue bases
and relatively stronger institutional autonomy and mandates. MCs in large cities are under-investing in
infrastructure relative to smaller cities, their own intrinsic capacity and investment needs, despite better
financial indicators. When adjusted for fiscal position, MCs spend less on capital expenditure than other
ULBs: despite having 3 times higher OSR per capita relative to municipalities and 15 times higher than
other smaller ULBs, their capital expenditure per capita is only 1.5 times higher than municipalities and 5
times higher than other ULBs. MCs have the lowest capital expenditure to operating surplus and revenue
ratios among all classes of ULBs (see Table 13).

The case of Gujarat may be illustrative: the scale of borrowing by Gujarat ULBs at 0.9% of capital investment
needs is miniscule given the context of strong devolution of functional and financial powers to Gujarat
ULBs, especially corporations. Municipal bonds have been largely in the form of one-off issuances by AMC.
The absence of bond issuances by AMC for twelve years prior to 2018, and the very negligible efforts to tap
other financing sources – are reflective of low demand for such financing.

These absorptive and implementation capacity constraints are driven by longstanding financial and
institutional weaknesses which constrain the ability of city agencies to meet the infrastructure needs.
There are several inter-related reasons for this, some of which are as follows:

     •	   Weak strategic capital planning to develop a pipeline of viable and feasible projects: ULBs
          generally do not prepare multi-year investment plans with a pipeline of investment-ready projects.
          Even where such plans are prepared, they do not translate into the statutory requirement of annual
          budgets with capex planning on an annual basis with (at best) notional allocations for medium-
          term expenditures. This leads to piecemeal project planning and capital investment prioritization
          being determined by availability of funding. Project preparation focuses more on technical scoping/


64                                                                 Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
        specifications and securing investment approvals from state (and, where relevant, national)
        governments rather than on service delivery, sustainability, and viability. These constraints exist in
        larger MCs with higher financial capacity (like AMC) which have tapped capital markets in the past.
        This limits demand for financing and the realization of even existing debt financing potential.
   •	   Weak project implementation/execution capacity: Even if projects are prepared, ULBs have
        limited technical capacity to fully appraise and implement them in a timely and cost-effective
        manner while also mitigating the substantial risks associated with urban infrastructure projects.
        Slow progress in implementation of projects under GoI Missions also appears to be because of
        difficulty in coming up with required matching funds, which further underlines the importance of
        revenue constraints.
   •	   Weak capacity to design, prepare and structure complex projects and transactions, and deal
        with private sector investors: This weak capacity in project structuring (risk allocation/sharing)
        adversely impacts projects’ risk profile especially for PPPs, with inadequate risk-sharing or risk-
        transfer mechanisms. There is limited experience in dealing with private lenders and investors, and
        lack of exposure at the city level to municipal borrowing and designing complex PPP transactions.
        PPPs especially require tighter developer-concessionaire coordination, which gets hampered due
        to limited delegation of powers for city agencies and weak institutional and technical capacity for
        investment planning and stakeholder engagement. This weakness in counterparty capacity has led
        to persistent state government support for several PPP transactions, as shown in earlier chapters.
In the presence of absorptive capacity constraints despite substantial unmet investment needs, it is not
surprising that higher fiscal transfers are ULBs’ preferred source to finance capex with limited demand
for private financing. Until absorptive capacity of ULBs increases, other actions to stimulate private
commercial financing may have limited effects.


5.1.3. Inter-governmental fiscal and institutional framework preventing higher demand from
emerging
Besides the policy decisions at the state and city levels to keep revenue levels below optimal levels, the
inter-governmental framework for urban governance in India is characterized by weak and fractured
functional devolution for ULBs coupled with weak accountability and perverse incentives facing ULBs.

ULBs generally do not have strong mandates for urban infrastructure due to weak and fractured functional
devolution. State governments - especially departments, state-controlled agencies, and parastatals - have
the primary role in urban service delivery and infrastructure except in a few states such as Maharashtra
and Gujarat. ULBs generally have limited institutional scope for provision of infrastructure and services.
Even within the functional mandates provided to ULBs, state governments exercise strong operational
control. The case of Tamil Nadu is illustrative and reflects the situation in most other states, despite it being
a highly urbanized state with ULBs of high capacity in large cities. Here, the state government has a strong
decision-making role in approving individual projects for ULB execution. Delegation of powers to ULBs is
low relative to the scale of capital expenditure even in large MCs. The centralization of decision making on
capital expenditure is reflected in the high share of tied fiscal transfers in urban investment and an outsized
share of state-owned FIs (TNUDF and TUFIDCO) in ULB borrowing. This weak authorizing environment and
low expenditure assignment for service provision directly influences demand for investment funds, which
translates into low demand for all commercial finance.

The institutional and fiscal framework reinforces the dependence of ULBs on state governments and
reduces their incentives to deliver urban infrastructure in a coordinated manner or to strengthen their
institutional capacity and creditworthiness. This has several inter-related aspects:

   •	   City managers are generally accountable to higher levels of government – especially state – with
        limited accountability to citizens. City managers take guidance from state governments with a
        limited role for elected councils. A vital link between urban citizens and urban management is
        thus weak or missing in Indian cities. Although there are some positive developments in some
        cities, citizen participation in capital planning, budgeting, and other urban development issues is
        quite low in most cities. Accountability and participation are weak, and so service needs are not
        translated through local engagement into actionable demands.


Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                  65
     •	   The high volume of tied fiscal transfers reduce incentives of ULBs towards investment planning
          and resource mobilization; and leads to fund utilization becoming a primary target rather than
          prioritizing service delivery improvement and diversifying sources of finance, even in credit-
          worthy cities. As shown in earlier chapters, as the salience and importance of urban development
          and existing urban infrastructure gaps has increased in recognition over recent decades, state
          governments and even GoI has substantially increased its investment in urban infrastructure, with
          GoI having several Urban Missions. Over half of fiscal transfers to ULBs are tied to specific projects
          and ULBs utilize these transfers as the primary (and in many cases only) financing source. This
          increase in fiscal transfers has two consequences:
           ̵ first, it reduces incentives to generate own revenues for additional surpluses or to build capacity
           	
             for service delivery improvement.
           	
           ̵ second, it re-orients the attention of urban managers from actual needs of their city to the
             requirements and processes that need to be in place to access grant funds.
     •	   The fiscal transfer system in India is often characterized by a relatively soft performance
          orientation, in practice if not always as a matter of policy, in areas such as robust service level
          improvement targets, required outcomes or OSR performance accountability.

5.1.4. Weak financial management and fiduciary performance with poor quality financial data
Weak fiduciary capacity, seen in weak accounting, auditing and disclosure of financial information by
ULBs and city agencies, undermines investor confidence and thus reduces the likelihood of successful
private financing. Reporting and auditing of financial accounts is an area of weakness despite substantial
reform efforts. Very few ULBs report their complete financial statements online, except for Gujarat where
accrual-based accounting has been introduced. Financial disclosure by parastatal agencies is even poorer.
There is no mandatory requirement for ULBs to prepare medium-term budgetary frameworks or even
capital investment plans in a standardized manner. Except for some states having performance-based
transfer mechanisms, there are limited requirements for ULBs pertaining to budgetary management and
financial responsibility.

These aspects limit the ability of investors to undertake an appraisal of potential financing opportunities.
Municipal bonds compete with corporate sector bonds for investments, without comparable levels of
information disclosure, resulting in low investor interest. The prevalence of extensive credit enhancements
and structuring requirements for municipal bonds relative to corporate bonds with similar rating profiles
is likely due to such constraints.


5.2. Factors impacting supply of private financing: national-level regulatory
and policy environment
The supply of private finance is primarily determined by the size, sophistication, and regulatory
environment of the domestic financial market. This is especially applicable to debt financing – including
term loans and municipal bonds. In India, GoI regulates all aspects of financial markets and the financial
sector, thus directly impacting the supply of private financing for urban infrastructure. This includes
prudential regulations, tax treatment of investments, municipal bond listing requirements issued by SEBI,
and regulations pertaining to investments made by large institutional investors such as insurance and
provident funds. State governments play a limited role, except in the case of state government-controlled
FIs in some states which finance urban infrastructure spending.

The regulatory framework at the national level impacting the supply of financing is not prohibitive
to a higher volume of private financing. It allows private financing for urban infrastructure, and in the
last decade has been further improved to facilitate this. While this factor does not appear to impose an
absolute constraint, it has limited impact on the volume of financing transacted as the key policy and
regulatory powers which intermediate supply and demand of financing are at state government level and
are not conducive, as shown in previous and subsequent sections.

The national-level regulatory framework for municipal borrowing especially municipal bonds has
become clearer with facilitating actions by GoI, SEBI and RBI to address the supply of finance. The World


66                                                                  Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
Bank provided an assessment of GoI and state-level factors impacting supply of financing for municipal
borrowing in 2011 which assessed constraints pertaining to the financial sector and various types of
institutional investors/lenders and provided proposals to address them (World Bank 2011). There have been
several regulatory changes since then which have addressed some of these constraints. For example:

   •	   foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been permitted to invest in municipal bonds since 2019,
        within the limits on SDL, and RBI has eased norms allowing them to invest in such bonds under
        prescribed limits to broaden access of non–resident investors to debt instruments in India.
   •	   SEBI has also issued regulations for issuance and listing of municipal debt securities (in 2015 and
        updated in 2019), along compliance requirements, which provide guidance for ULBs to access
        capital markets, covers eligibility conditions, requirements for public issue and private placement,
        and for listing/trading of municipal bonds. SEBI has been proactive in making changes to streamline
        regulations further and has an advisory committee for enhancing the municipal debt securities in
        India. Recent revisions in 2019 revised the rules for continuing post-issuance disclosure regulations.
        However, it is worth noting that these recent regulations on disclosure do impose a compliance
        burden on ULBs, as the objective of these regulations is investor protection. While they may indeed
        help private investors these disclosure regulations are likely to be more useful when a secondary
        market for municipal bonds emerges. Further, any SEBI requirements for disclosure do not apply
        in the case of bank loans (or unlisted private placement of bond issues), so ULBs have an incentive
        to prefer bank loans over bond issuances to avoid the compliance burden and associated expenses
        and potential legal liabilities.
   •	   GoI has also moved away from providing tax-free status to municipal bonds and has instead
        provided an incentive scheme under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
Some gaps and constraints remain in the national-level framework, however, notably pertaining to
guidelines for investment by pension funds and insurance companies, and national regulations pertaining
to treatment of recovery and default for municipal debt, which put municipal debt at a competitive
disadvantage relative to corporate borrowing or other forms of government borrowing.

Moreover, supply of debt financing from publicly owned FIs is also crowding out private finance in
some states. This issue is prevalent in Tamil Nadu. Debt financing from state government controlled
FIs (TNUDF and TUFIDCO) is crowding out borrowing from private sources, causing a trade-off between
public and private commercial financing. This is due to a differentiated regime for public and private
financing which privileges state-controlled FIs and implicitly disincentivizes and discourages ULBs from
accessing private financing.

A differentiated set of rules, approval processes and loan terms in Tamil Nadu between private and
state-controlled banks/FIs is driven by two factors which contribute to a non-level playing field for
municipal debt and limit borrowing from private sector. First, institutions like TNUDF and TUFIDCO
offer concessional terms relative to market borrowing. Such terms and accompanying grant funds are not
available when city agencies seek to raise private financing. Second, loan approvals by these institutions
are linked with infrastructure programs and schemes of GoTN. For instance, loans from TNUDF are often
towards pre-identified projects selected for support under multi-lateral programs. Loan sanctions follow a
well-laid out appraisal process guided by TNUDF’s lending policy and its delegation of powers, compared
to private financing which requires ULBs to seek case-by-case approval of GoTN.


5.3. Intermediation of Demand & Supply: state-level regulatory and
policy factors
The regulatory framework at the state level is not conducive to creating an environment where
regular borrowing and/or PPP transactions can happen for urban infrastructure, despite a relatively
robust framework at the national level which facilitates the supply of private financing. This is because of
poorly defined regulatory systems at the state government level, heavy reliance by city agencies on state
government authorization and discretion at the level of each transaction, and weaknesses and lack of
clarity in ex-post procedures to provide dispute resolution with investors and deal with potential defaults
by ULB on borrowing, resulting in investors facing substantial risk.


Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                               67
The relationship between state governments and city agencies – and the regulatory and oversight
role of state governments - underpins and influences all aspects of urban infrastructure financing
regardless of source of financing. As shown in previous chapters, state governments have the paramount
role in overseeing all affairs of ULBs and city agencies in their territory. This includes having primary
responsibility to regulate the mandates, scope, and financial activities of all ULBs, city agencies and
utilities, including all aspects pertaining to accessing (public or private) commercial sources of finance.
This set of powers include most factors which determine the demand for all commercial financing by
ULBs and city agencies as well as the intermediation of demand and supply of finance.

The state-level policy and regulatory framework is not in itself prohibitive of private financing, but
the nature of this framework and the institutional and political relationship between states and ULBs
involves a tightly controlled set of financing activities, covering both borrowing and PPPs. All financing
transactions are mandated and authorized with state government support. This effectively means that
ULBs are functioning more as agencies of the state government rather than as independent market
players. This inevitably dampens financing activity and investor appetite, resulting in limited number and
volume of transactions. In many cases, state governments are both the authorizer as well as the financer
of transactions, as documented in the case of TNUDF and TUFIDCO in Tamil Nadu.

state governments are responsible for the full set of ex-ante rules, regulations and procedures
determining access to, and origination of, all sources of finance. This includes regulations and procedures
pertaining to the purpose, authorization, limits, financial characteristics, tenor, types of securities offered,
sources of repayment and accounting, reporting and disclosures related to borrowing or bond issues,
and similar aspects for PPP transactions especially rates and levels of tariffs, service charges etc. While
the nature of specific regulations varies somewhat across states, key features of state- level regulations
governing ex-ante aspects of financing are summarized below32:

     •	   Approval for municipal borrowing: ULBs require the approval of state governments to borrow in
          all states, often on an individual case-by-case basis. In some cases (such as Tamil Nadu) a financial
          plan is approved whereafter ULBs are free to borrow within the limits contained in such a plan
          without further approval. However, the process to grant these approvals is not clearly defined to
          guide ULBs in most states. Most states allow ULBs to raise loans for specific purposes including
          project implementation, land acquisition etc. In a few states, short-term loans for bridging recurring
          expenditure (paying salaries and dues) are explicitly prohibited.
     •	   Loan limits and structures: Most states stipulate borrowing limits and loan tenors in law (Gujarat
          being an exception) using a variety of standards such as the volume of total borrowing, value of
          ULB-owned property, size of potential tax base. Such limits are not tied to actual creditworthiness
          or borrowing capacity of ULBs, and data available to develop these indicators are poor. Thus, they
          are not an effective way to assess, manage or mitigate borrowing risks.
     •	   Security: All states allow for pledging and escrow of local revenues as a form of security, and most
          loan transactions are characterized by such structures. Three states (Gujarat, Maharashtra and
          Andhra Pradesh provide for explicit support for hypothecation of municipal assets which provides
          additional clarity. Limits on mortgaging assets are generally restrictive in many states.
     •	   state guarantees: The issuance of state guarantees for municipal loans has been impacted by
          introduction of Fiscal Responsibility legislation in several states. Issuance of such guarantees
          requires approval of finance departments of the state government. The criteria for issuance of
          guarantees, authorization process and timing are unclear.
There is also weakness and lack of clarity in ex-post procedures to provide dispute resolution with
investors and deal with potential defaults by ULB on borrowing, which substantially increases the
risk for investors. State governments are responsible for dealing with such situations, including potential
intervention in case of municipal/city default, reorganization, and debt work-out arrangements. In general,


32
  	 This section draws on The World Bank 2011 report on municipal borrowing in India - with updates to reflect current
practice – as there has not been substantial change since then in state-level rules and regulations pertaining to debt
financing for municipalities, ULBs and city agencies. That report may be consulted for a detailed discussion of these
regulatory constraints, which are re-stated here in brief.



68                                                                    Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
the ex-post regulations are weak and there are limited to no institutionalized frameworks or procedures to
implement ex-post interventions to deal with such situations. Further, as in ex-ante procedures, there has
been very limited improvement in the last decade in clarifying and establishing procedures to deal with
cases of default by city agencies on municipal borrowing, and clear dispute resolution mechanisms to
deal with problems in PPP transactions and rights of investors. The World Bank’s 2011 report on municipal
borrowing in India provided an assessment of these issues and proposals to address them. As that
report notes, “the prevailing regulatory regime for municipal borrowing dampens potential borrowing
activity and makes the sector unattractive for investors relative to others. Both borrowers and lenders run
substantial transaction risk.”

This highly centralized direct control framework contrasts with international best practice, which
primarily include market-based or rules-based systems. This includes well-established frameworks such
as South Africa, Philippines, Poland, Hungary and Mexico among emerging economies, and the United
states, United Kingdom and Austria among industrialized economies.


5.4. Summary and Implications
The discussion above has shown that the primary constraints preventing higher volume of private
financing for urban infrastructure in India are on the demand side. These are: the policy and political
economy decisions impacting revenue levels and funding base for private financing; weak absorptive and
implementation capacity of city agencies for capital expenditure; and the restrictive inter-governmental
framework which reduces accountability and incentives for city agencies. The demand side has a critical
role as it needs to initiate the process – but these factors do not allow adequate demand to be developed
and elicited. The next most critical constraint appears to be state-level regulatory and policy factors which
intermediate demand and supply of finance. These are aggravated by a set of secondary constraints
including factors related to the financial market that dampen supply of finance, and weak financial
management and fiduciary performance. Table 14 summarizes these constraints considering this report’s
analytical framework.

This shows that the binding constraints are not primarily on the supply side but related to the demand
side and the regulatory frameworks which intermediate demand and supply. Since supply tends
to follow demand, there will not be an adequate supply-side response unless such demand-side and
regulatory constraints are resolved. The case of South Africa is illustrative: municipal borrowing expanded
significantly and rapidly (in nominal terms) once regulatory and demand side (or ‘creditworthiness’) issues
were systematically addressed in the mid-2000s. Such borrowing – from both private and public sources
of financing - had remained relatively stagnant for the decade prior to these reforms but grew almost 3.5
times in nominal terms in the period 2006/07 to 2020/2133.

This report shows that low levels of private financing in urban infrastructure is primarily a fiscal and
institutional problem. To a significant extent, India does not necessarily have a problem pertaining
only to low private financing in urban infrastructure, since the low levels reflect these institutional and
fiscal realities outlined above. Financing will remain constrained until the existing fiscal and institutional
realities shift, with policy decisions to increase taxes and user-charges to economic levels so that the
investment finance required for municipal infrastructure can be funded. Thus, it is worth stating that the
most important reforms to increase private financing for urban infrastructure have little to do directly
with such financing itself.

Chapter 6.
Proposals for Policy Actions
6.1. Two pathways forward: structural reforms and targeted incremental
actions
Investment in urban infrastructure and services remains significantly short of needs across India. A
history of initiatives notwithstanding, private financing through borrowing and PPP has not attained
anywhere near the desired scale and volume. The review of trends and constraints in this report shows
that increasing private financing to a level that makes a substantial contribution to urban infrastructure
needs depends on improving the revenue base, creditworthiness, and institutional capacity of ULBs and
city agencies.

Despite these constraints, there is a set of large high potential cities which are currently not leveraging
sufficient commercial financing relative to their current potential and thus should be the focus of
immediate attention via targeted support to provide incremental progress. This report showed that
27 large MCs nationwide (excluding Mumbai) which received an investment grade credit rating under
AMRUT have the financial capacity to currently borrow an additional USD 7.7 - 8.4 bn on commercial
basis, which is more than 20 times their existing level of debt stock. Mumbai ULB alone can borrow an
additional USD 5 billion. While this is still well below the required investment needs in these cities it also
shows that they can borrow substantially more even at current or slightly higher levels of revenue growth.
These 28 cities (including Mumbai) account for about a fifth of India’s urban population. This pool of
relatively high potential cities can be further expanded to include other MCs in the 4 states classified as
Cluster 1 in earlier chapters (namely Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu). These cities did not
receive investment-grade credit rating but can improve their creditworthiness with additional effort and
technical assistance. This takes the total of high potential cities to around 70, covering an estimated 29% of
the total national urban population, and provides the starting point for focused attention for incremental
change in the short- to medium-term.

Policy actions to address this gap require a combination of structural reforms to address some of the
core binding constraints as well as a set of incremental and targeted actions that facilitate private
commercial financing flows in the short- to medium- term. This chapter proposes actions under both
these broad categories.


6.1.1. Structural reforms to address core fiscal and institutional constraints
A set of reforms are needed to address the core fiscal, institutional and revenue constraints for all
cities, which will have a fundamental impact across the system on increasing private financing for
urban infrastructure. If actions on these areas are not taken, private financing will remain low in the
medium to long term.34 This wide-ranging reform agenda broadly covers the following aspects:

     •	   The inter-governmental fiscal transfer system (at both national and state levels) should move
          to a more stable, formula-based, and unconditional fiscal transfer regime. About half of all
          fiscal transfers to ULBs currently are tied funds for specific projects which creates accountability
          and incentive issues as shown earlier. A reformed fiscal transfer system will address some of the
          identified long-standing issues across all types of cities. The report to the 15th Finance Commission
          also recommends an increase in unconditional transfers to ULBs to 0.32% of GDP by FY25. Well-
          designed conditional transfers, such as performance- or results-based financing, can also improve
          institutional outcomes, as seen in some states where such mechanisms are under implementation.
          Growth in fiscal transfers should be pegged with nominal GDP/GSDP growth with a phased increase
          in the share of untied devolution transfers.

  	 The fact that these reforms are outlined here does not imply that it is believed these reforms are all – or even mostly -
likely. As noted, the areas to be addressed may not be tractable in the short-medium term. The point, however, is that
the scope for mobilizing private commercial finance into urban infrastructure will always be limited to the extent that
these constraints are not addressed.

Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                              71
     •	   Cities’ fiscal base will be improved by addressing revenue constraints through buoyant revenue
          base and cost recovery of services. The critical policy reform needed to improve the fiscal and
          revenue base and municipal creditworthiness is the need for a buoyant local revenue base and
          cost recovery of urban infrastructure investments, through revising property taxes, user fees and
          service charges and other specific revenue streams. Without drastic changes in the user charges
          regime directed at charging more economic rates, PPP projects will predominantly depend on
          fiscal support via availability payments for bankability. The goal should be to double OSR of key
          ULBs and parastatal agencies every five years, as that is the level of growth needed to support a
          funding base sufficient enough to raise commercial financing for estimated investment needs.
          States should also rationalize user charges to cover all O&M costs in municipal services for which
          tariffs can be levied. The 15th Finance Commission has already recommended steps in this direction
          by linking the devolution of fiscal transfers to ULBs to OSR improvement (specifically improvements
          in property tax revenue, through both revised rates and stronger collection performance) as well as
          fiduciary measures such as the conduct and disclosure independent audits of annual accounts. GoI
          is adopting these recommendations as eligibility criteria for fiscal transfers and as possible entry
          level conditionalities in future Urban Missions.
     •	   Gradually increasing the mandates of city agencies will improve their accountability and
          incentives. As has been frequently argued elsewhere, states should aim to gradually transition
          urban service delivery functions to ULBs and city-level institutions consistent with principles of the
          74th Constitutional Amendment Act35. As an example, state-level management of urban water and
          sewerage functions may be devolved in a time-bound manner. An improved urban legal framework
          that includes a stable and certain fiscal transfer regime, accords financial powers to ULBs along
          with attendant rules/regulations to operationalize commercial financing will resolve several of the
          identified institutional constraints. These reforms will improve creditworthiness for a larger set of
          cities and progress on these aspects, or lack thereof, will determine the medium- to long-term scale
          of investment flows for urban infrastructure.
The importance of increasing OSR performance to fill the urban investment gap and raise commercial
financing for this purpose can be seen from the following estimate: If aggregate OSR for ULBs nationwide
can be doubled every 5 years over the next 15 years (which requires OSR to increase by 16% per annum
over this period), the capital expenditure capacity of ULBs can increase to about 90% of their investment
needs over this period. Crucially, at such levels of OSR, as much as one-fifth of this investment can be
met through raising commercial financing in this scenario (subject to certain assumptions). On the other
hand, under a business-as-usual scenario where OSR increases at the historical growth rate of around 10%
per annum over the next 15 years, the capital expenditure capacity of ULBs will cover only 70% of their
infrastructure investment needs over this period, and only 8% of this investment can be met through
commercial financing, as OSR levels will be too low to support higher commercial financing. These
estimates highlight the importance of increasing the OSR base to expand urban investment capacity.

This list of policy actions is to address the existing structural issues with fiscal transfers and low ULB
revenues to provide sufficient funding to pay for commercial financing, without which such financing
will be highly constrained. These proposals also reflect long-standing political economy issues on which
progress is likely going to be difficult. Given this, a set of targeted actions are also proposed to provide
incremental progress in a set of high potential cities.


6.1.2. Targeted actions to provide incremental progress in medium term in selected high potential cities
Beyond the structural constraints which may be intractable in the shorter term, the situation varies
across different types of ULB, with a group of large, better financially endowed cities ready for focused
support. This can catalyze financing and demonstrate outcomes for wider replication. This set of 28 high
potential ULBs already have a relatively stronger revenue base which is not being fully leveraged and better
institutional capacity, and they are essentially creditworthy at this stage. The challenge is to enable them
to reach their full potential of commercial finance. Previous flagship missions have tended to support a
larger number of cities (e.g., 60+ under JNNURM, 100+ under SCM, and around 500 under AMRUT).

For this group of cities, institutional factors appear to be key constraints including absorptive and
implementation capacity and muted incentives to perform at a high level of investment expenditure,
as evidenced by unspent recurrent surpluses, slow implementation of projects including GoI Urban
Missions, compounded by other factors such as weaknesses in the regulatory frameworks, as outlined
in the previous chapter. In significant respects, these are also structural factors with a political economy
basis and are not anticipated to see rapid change in circumstances.  However, as evidenced by some
transactions, such as the occasional municipal bond issues and PPPs, it is possible to get some traction
on some of these issues, including expanding absorptive capacity of MCs within the current basic ULB-
state structure, which is aligned with the incentives of state-level leaders.  There are also a set of non-
structural actions possible, outlined below, which are currently feasible and tractable, but would bear fruit
as absorptive capacity constraints are addressed to provide higher demand for financing. This is where
the short- and medium-term proposals of this report are focused.

The selected set of targeted actions which will provide incremental progress in the nearer term includes
among others: actions to provide facilitation, technical assistance, institutional strengthening and capacity
building for ULBs and municipal utilities to increase their absorptive capacity (investment planning and
project design and execution) and their ability to interact with and conduct private financing transactions with
investors; financial management; service delivery accountability at the city level; information dissemination,
convening, and “building the case” among stakeholders for private investment in urban infrastructure; and
removing specific market frictions in the supply of financing and the regulatory environment.

Increased commercial financing will also bring substantial additional benefits beyond helping bridge the
large financing gap. GoI and state governments should also prioritize increasing market-based borrowing
due to the potential role of commercial borrowing in inducing improved financial management practices
in ULBs and city agencies. Commercial borrowing enforces a level of financial discipline in the borrowing
agency, which improves overall fiduciary quality. This can be considered as “demand-driven improved
creditworthiness” as opposed to the supply-driven improvements in creditworthiness which have generally
been the norm in India due to municipal borrowing targets under GoI Urban Missions and top-down
incentives by GoI for financial sector participants to increase municipal lending. Further, PPPs also play a
substantial role in professionalizing the provision of key basic services and infrastructure, by introducing
technical competence and discipline in these sectors. These non-monetary benefits of commercial financing
are substantial. They help further improve both the absorptive capacity and creditworthiness of cities.

To implement these actions, state governments have a primary role to play in creating conditions
that enable higher levels of private financing, given their position in overseeing all affairs of ULBs and
city agencies as shown in this report. Thus, most of the needed reforms fall to state governments. GoI can
provide additional technical assistance to states across this entire spectrum of substantial and incremental
reforms. It can also use its primary position as regulator and facilitator to advance reforms, facilitate and
convene stakeholders and help address specific constraints in the intermediation between demand and
supply of private financing.

The following sections describe specific policy actions that GoI and state governments can undertake
to address the identified constraints.

6.2. State-level actions to address constraints on demand for financing and
the regulatory environment
6.2.1. Increasing demand for private financing in selected high potential cities
Improving cities’ absorptive capacity: state governments should focus first on improving the absorptive
capacity of large, financially endowed cities that will help improve demand for private financing. This can
include the following actions:

   •	   Strategic capital investment planning and building a pipeline of investment projects in specific
        large cities. States should support cities and monitor the preparation of prioritized multi-year
        investment and financing plans considering service gaps, identified sources of financing and visible
        fiscal transfers; and provide policy guidance to operationalize these investment and financing plans
        at ULB level.

Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                                 73
     •	   Improving capacity of ULBs and city agencies in specific large cities to develop and implement
          bankable projects and complex PPP transactions. This should be done through dedicated city-
          level technical assistance and advisory activities to the respective city agencies, and development
          of state-level frameworks & standards. States should aim to strengthen institutional capacity and
          creditworthiness of ULBs and parastatals to position them as credible counterparties for private
          investors and FIs.
           	
           ̵ Access to skills/people with the expertise to design commercial transactions for private
             financing and engage with private investors/financiers is also critical to the ability of cities to
             attract private capital and manage the process of accessing that capital. States should work
             with ULBs to have such capacity available, either internally or outsourced. States should improve
             the capacity of municipal staff for this work including their ability to interface with and manage
             private investors/financiers.
           	
           ̵ This is especially important for PPPs, where state governments need to work closely with city
             agencies to prepare specific projects (and a pipeline of projects) in high potential sectors and
             services, including MSW, bus services/terminals etc. and implementing threshold reforms
             required to improve bankability of these projects. State governments and the high-potential
             cities should have a strategic focus on prioritizing the development of a set of PPP-viable
             projects rather than one-off transactions.
     •	   A program of performance-based fiscal transfers can help improve absorptive and institutional
          capacity of ULBs across a range of required aspects. Such a program can link these performance-
          based fiscal transfers to institutional results (related to investment planning, project execution
          capacity, service delivery outcomes, among others) rather than tied to specific investment projects.
          Such a program can supplement existing unconditional, formula-based fiscal transfers.
Demand for financing – and incentives of ULBs to access this financing - will also increase if state
governments increase decentralization of capital expenditure decisions to ULBs, by delegating higher
administrative sanction powers at ULB level, starting with larger Corporations, and mandating operational
service delivery targets.

Improving cities’ fiduciary & financial management quality and OSR performance: Municipal
creditworthiness and funding capacity of ULBs and utilities will improve through better public financial
management systems. State governments can undertake a wide set of actions to improve this aspect.
This includes among others: developing (or implementing national-level) accounting standards for ULBs
and standards for financial auditing and disclosures of financial statements; ensuring availability and
consistency of reliable financial data; improving the ability and capacity of ULBs to collect recurrent
revenue from their assigned sources, through better fiduciary systems, human resources, and information
technology tools, among others; and improving the capacity of local human resources responsible for
running ULBs and city agencies. These actions will collectively provide confidence to investors/financiers
on the overall quality of financial management and revenue systems.


6.2.2. Improving state-level regulatory environment for private financing
state governments need to revise the regulatory environment to create more conducive conditions for
municipal borrowing and PPP activity. Proposed actions include the following:

     •	   Revising ex-ante rules and procedures governing ULB access to private finance especially
          borrowing: States should transition to a rules-based allocation/funding process instead of a
          direct control system whereby every individual transaction is approved on a case-by-case basis
          upon application of a ULB / city agency. Most of these policy actions were also recommended by
          the World Bank in its 2011 report on municipal borrowing in India, and there has not been any
          significant change in the status quo at the state level since then (World Bank 2011). That report may
          be consulted for a detailed treatment of each of these, which includes specific recommendations
          for regulations concerning transactional approval processes; purpose of borrowing; limits on long-
          term borrowing; terms pertaining to use of municipal assets as security and collateral; and, finally,
          provision of guarantees by the state government.
     •	


74                                                                  Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
   •	   Clarifying and improving ex-post procedures to provide dispute resolution with investors and
        deal with potential defaults by ULB on borrowing: Similar to ex-ante procedures, there has
        been little improvement in the last decade in clarifying ex-post procedures to deal with cases of
        default on municipal borrowing, and clear dispute resolution mechanisms for problems in PPP
        transactions and rights of investors. Systematic support is needed for dispute resolution between
        city agencies and investors/creditors, for both borrowing and PPPs, to reduce investors’ risk
        perception. A key element to success of PPPs is the presence of credible public counterparties
        that can hold the private partner accountable while honoring its contractual obligations; and the
        existence of a credible dispute resolution mechanism in case such obligations are not met. State
        governments should also create formal, institutionalized Administrators responsible for municipal
        insolvency resolution within existing laws, and over the long term, formally constituted Municipal
        Debt Tribunals. The 2011 report provides detailed assessment of these actions.
State governments should also aim to reform the state-controlled FIs to transition from concessional
financiers to more sophisticated entities which facilitate private financing. As noted earlier, these FIs
are crowding out private finance by providing debt to city agencies generally on non-market, concessional
bases; and have not been able to raise financing themselves from the financial market. In large states like
Tamil Nadu and Gujarat there is minimal debt financing on market basis, despite substantial potential,
possibly due to the presence of such institutions. Over time, these institutions could transition to become
financial support facilities which undertake the functions such as a) providing technical support and/
or financing to ULBs and city agencies for project preparation and origination of transaction; and b)
providing financing or credit enhancement facilities through limited underwriting designed to leverage
and crowd-in private financing (e.g. partial risk guarantees routed through commercial banks) rather
than fully financing loans to ULBs.


6.3. Central Government-level actions to support ambitious reform agenda
and incremental progress
To help state governments achieve this ambitious and wide-ranging reform agenda, GoI can provide
substantial assistance using its primary position as regulator and facilitator to advance reforms, facilitate
and convene stakeholders, provide targeted technical assistance, and help address specific constraints
in the supply of financing and its regulatory environment. It can undertake several incremental actions
which can be readily implemented.

GoI can undertake these policy actions under two inter-related categories which will help develop the
overall market for urban infrastructure finance and provide support to specific cities and transactions:
First, it should provide facilitation, technical assistance and capacity building support to states and
target cities and help remove specific market frictions. Second, it should use its position as regulator
and facilitator for dissemination of information, convening stakeholders, and building the case for private
financing for urban infrastructure.


6.3.1. Facilitation, technical assistance, capacity building and removing market frictions
Developing a Cities Investment Support Unit: GoI could establish a dedicated structure, such as a Cities
Investment Support Unit, to focus on urban infrastructure finance within an appropriate Ministry to assist
specific states and cities with regulatory reform, transaction preparation and implementation for private
financing including borrowing and PPP transactions.

This Unit should focus its activities (either conducted on its own or in partnership with relevant Ministries,
agencies, and other stakeholders) initially on the 28 large cities which are currently best placed to access
private financing, followed soon after by focusing on the additional set of high potential cities in the 4
states classified as Cluster 1 in earlier chapters (namely Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu).

This unit can have the following activities:

   •	   Nurturing partnerships between GoI agencies and regulators, states, selected ULBs, and financial
        sector organizations (such as potential lenders and institutional investors), including through



Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs                                                               75
          convening a working group of national and regional stakeholders to build and maintain consensus
          on means for increasing private finance for urban infrastructure.
     •	   Supporting and mentoring states, ULBs, and other potential borrowers with technical assistance
          and training in developing long term financial strategies, interacting with financial markets,
          and related matters, including through provision of access to skills/people with the expertise to
          design commercial transactions for private financing and engage with private investors/financiers.
          This Unit should work with states and ULBs to have such capacity available, either internally or
          outsourced, including their ability to interface with and manage private investors/financiers. This
          can include a network of independent infrastructure finance advisors to work with potential
          borrowers in preparations for, and interactions with, the capital markets.
     •	   Technical assistance to states on improving the fiscal and regulatory frameworks, including
          assistance on specific land value capture instruments to help finance infrastructure.
     •	   Supporting states to remove specific hindrances, such as reforming processes for borrowing and
          transaction approvals – especially the differentiated processes for public or private commercial
          financing
     •	   Supporting states improve financial management of cities: While there exists a national accounts
          manual used by GoI and state governments, the apparent absence of a standard chart of accounts
          for ULBs is a bottleneck to be readily addressed. GoI can advance this reform building on progress
          in several states on standardizing accounting standards for ULBs, in consultation with Accounting
          Standards Board and MoF.

6.3.2. Information dissemination, convening, “building the case”
A key role of the GoI will be to use its convening and regulatory powers to shape this agenda at scale.
The ability to mobilize others through convening power will be important to building the market for
private financing of urban infrastructure. This will be a leading role for GoI Ministries in collaboration with
state Governments and the set of financial sector regulatory agencies. The following is a set of actions
that can be taken:

     •	   Sharing strategies with prospective financiers through dialogues: Working with interested state
          and city officials, GoI can convene workshops for various lender and investor groups and selected
          borrowing ULBs to build relationship between lenders/investors and borrowers based on long
          term infrastructure and financial plans. International experience shows that FIs often do not fully
          understand municipal finance while city officials are not acquainted with what is needed to provide
          comfort to prospective investors. Potential lenders and investors include banks, pension funds,
          insurance companies, fund managers etc. with each type of institution having its preferences,
          requirements, and investment appetite. Each type of FI / potential investor needs to be consulted
          to understand their appetites for various instruments and terms, governance and regulatory
          constraints, and their potential role in developing the municipal debt market.
     •	   Building the business case for urban investment: Dialogues convened by GoI will also help expose
          FIs to the potential of the market for financing urban infrastructure, to GoI’s policy toward such
          investments, and to revenue streams available to support infrastructure financing. Such dialogues
          can provide information about the potential size of the potential market and can help state
          governments and GoI formulate appropriate polices and expectations. It is suggested to create
          an Urban Finance Working Group to facilitate this. Experience from South Africa shows that such
          a working group, housed in its National Treasury, convenes stakeholders including public and
          private FIs, officials from cities that borrow for infrastructure, rating agencies, etc. It can provide an
          opportunity for GoI to disseminate data and signal and test policy initiatives and for cities and FIs
          to present needs and constraints.
     •	   Building and expanding data systems and information disclosures on urban financing: A thriving
          ecosystem of private investment will include credible and publicly available data, and independent
          analysis and research on municipal finance trends. Building on MoHUA’s new portal providing
          analytical inputs from audited financial statements of ULBs nationwide (www.cityfinance.in),
          investors will benefit from systems that provides readily accessible data on municipal finance
          and investment needs. This should be continuously updated and include data about borrowing,


76                                                                    Financing India’s urban infrastructure needs
      maturities, structures etc. If possible, such data should be integrated into, or draw from, broader
      municipal finance database(s) that would also provide information on operating and capital budgets,
      quarterly statements of financial performance, and audited financial statements. GoI Ministries can
      work with financial sector regulators to support dissemination of information on borrowing of ULBs
      and urban parastatal bodies. While RBI can work with banks to publish information on borrowing,
      SEBI can facilitate a repository of information on municipal bond transactions (past and planned).
      RBI may also prepare periodic report on ULB finances along similar lines as its state Finances report.
      In addition, state Governments should be asked to disclose all approvals accorded for borrowing by
      ULBs and parastatals along with total loans sanctioned, disbursed and repayment track records.
