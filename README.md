## Requirements & Setup

This repository is designed to work with **no custom configuration**.

### What you need

- **Obsidian** (desktop)
- **Git** (installed on your system)
- *(Optional but recommended)* **Obsidian Git** community plugin

That’s it.

---

### How to use

1. Clone this repository using Git.
2. Open Obsidian.
3. Select **“Open folder as vault”**.
4. Choose the cloned repository folder.

The notes will work immediately.

No build steps.  
No special plugins required.

---

### Syncing changes (optional)

To sync notes across devices or back up changes:

- Use Git directly (`git pull`, `git commit`, `git push`), **or**
- Install the **Obsidian Git** community plugin and enable automatic sync.

The plugin simply runs Git commands for you — the repository remains standard and usable without it.

### Important note

All content in this repository is plain **Markdown**.

Obsidian is just the editor.  
Git is just the transport.

If either disappears, the notes remain readable and intact.
