**user**: #### 3.3.16. Climate-Resilient Urban Habitat

1. Climate resilience is foundational to Anantha’s design. The city anticipates and adapts to climate risks through:
    - Nature-based solutions
    - Distributed energy and water systems
    - Flood-resilient landscapes
    - Heat-mitigating urban form
    - Adaptive governance supported by real-time data

Rather than resisting change, Anantha evolves continuously in response to environmental and social feedback.
