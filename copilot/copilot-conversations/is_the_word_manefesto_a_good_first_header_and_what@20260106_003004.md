**ai**: The word "manifesto" can be a strong and evocative choice for a header, as it suggests a declaration of principles, intentions, and beliefs. It implies a bold statement of purpose.

However, considering the content of your [[Anantha home]] note, which emphasizes a "city-scale operating system" built on "care, intelligence, and balance," and aims to "heal rather than exhaust," here are some alternative header options that might better align with its tone and philosophy:

**More aligned with "operating system" and "systemic" approach:**

*   **Anantha: A City-Scale Operating System** (This is already used as a subtitle, but could be a primary header)
*   **Anantha: The Regenerative Urban System**
*   **Anantha: A Blueprint for Future Urbanism**
*   **Anantha: The Living City Framework**
*   **Anantha: An Urban Operating System**

**More aligned with "care," "healing," and "well-being":**

*   **Anantha: A City Designed to Heal**
*   **Anantha: Cultivating Urban Well-being**
*   **Anantha: The Compassionate City**
*   **Anantha: Nurturing Urban Ecosystems and Communities**

**More aligned with "wealth" and "value creation":**

*   **Anantha: Redefining Urban Wealth**
*   **Anantha: The Value Engine for a Thriving Future**
*   **Anantha: Wealth Beyond Measure**

**More direct and foundational:**

*   **Anantha: Our Vision for Urban Civilization**
*   **Anantha: Principles for a New Urban Era**

Ultimately, the best choice depends on the specific emphasis you want to convey. If you want to highlight the innovative and declarative nature, "Manifesto" works. If you want to emphasize the systemic, regenerative, or compassionate aspects, one of the alternatives might be more fitting.
