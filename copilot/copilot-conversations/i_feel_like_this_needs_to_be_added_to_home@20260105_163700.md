**user**: i feel like this needs to be added to home and a page dedicated to it #### 3.3.11. Walkable, Green Urban Habitat

1. Anantha prioritises pedestrians over vehicles. Compact neighbourhoods, shaded streets, cycling networks, green corridors, and mixed-use development ensure that daily needs are accessible within walking distance.
2. Green infrastructure performs multiple functions—cooling the city, managing stormwater, enhancing biodiversity, and improving public health.

#### 3.3.12. Steward for regenerative forest

Anantha priorities degraded land and focuses on creating regenerative forest, where the urban habitat becomes steward of regenerative forest and ensures that there is a symbiotic relation between the development and environment, habitat and forest.

#### 3.3.13. Circular Economy as an Urban Ethos

1. Waste is eliminated by design. Materials, energy, water, and nutrients circulate within closed-loop systems.
2. Key principles include:
    1. Design for reuse, repair, and disassembly
    2. Local resource loops
    3. Energy-positive buildings
    4. Zero-waste food and material systems
    5. The city itself becomes a regenerative metabolism rather than a linear consumer of resources.

**ai**: You're right, these are important aspects that would fit well in your [[Home]] note and deserve their own dedicated pages for further development.

To confirm, you'd like to:
1.  Add the content of "3.3.11. Walkable, Green Urban Habitat", "3.3.12. Steward for regenerative forest", and "3.3.13. Circular Economy as an Urban Ethos" to your [[Home]] note.
2.  Create separate notes for each of these sections.

I recommend adding these sections under the "3.3. Redefining Wealth" section in your [[Home]] note, following the existing structure.

Here's how you can add them to your [[Home]] note:

```markdown
### 3.3. Redefining Wealth: A Multi-Dimensional Framework
...
#### 3.3.11. Walkable, Green Urban Habitat

1. Anantha prioritises pedestrians over vehicles. Compact neighbourhoods, shaded streets, cycling networks, green corridors, and mixed-use development ensure that daily needs are accessible within walking distance.
2. Green infrastructure performs multiple functions—cooling the city, managing stormwater, enhancing biodiversity, and improving public health.

#### 3.3.12. Steward for regenerative forest

Anantha priorities degraded land and focuses on creating regenerative forest, where the urban habitat becomes steward of regenerative forest and ensures that there is a symbiotic relation between the development and environment, habitat and forest.

#### 3.3.13. Circular Economy as an Urban Ethos

And here are the contents for the dedicated notes:

**For [[Walkable, Green Urban Habitat]]:**

**user**: #### 3.3.16. Climate-Resilient Urban Habitat

1. Climate resilience is foundational to Anantha’s design. The city anticipates and adapts to climate risks through:
    - Nature-based solutions
    - Distributed energy and water systems
    - Flood-resilient landscapes
    - Heat-mitigating urban form
    - Adaptive governance supported by real-time data

Rather than resisting change, Anantha evolves continuously in response to environmental and social feedback. this aswell
