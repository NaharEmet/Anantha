**ai**: It looks like you're referring to the Eleventy build error from our last conversation regarding your digital garden.

The error was:
**Eleventy build error: (Eleventy) Having multiple `index.md` files in your project that resolve to the same output path (e.g., `dist/index.html`) can cause conflicts.**

Specifically, these two files were identified as trying to write to `dist/index.html`:
- `./src/site/notes/src/site/notes/index.md`
- `./src/site/notes/index.md`

This means you likely have a duplicate `index.md` file or a configuration issue causing Eleventy to process the same file twice or two different files to the same output.

To fix this, you should:
1.  **Check for duplicate files:** Look inside your `src/site/notes/` directory for an extra `index.md` file. It seems like one might be nested incorrectly.
2.  **Review Eleventy configuration:** If you're using a custom `.eleventy.js` configuration, ensure that only one file is designated as the home page or that your input directories are set up correctly to avoid this conflict.
