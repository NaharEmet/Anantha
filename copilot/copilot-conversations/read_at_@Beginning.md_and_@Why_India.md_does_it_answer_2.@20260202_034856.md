**user**: read at @Beginning.md and @Why India.md does it answer 2. The “why” needs sharper India-specific grounding    
The “why” is present but feels broad and generic. It would benefit a lot from deeper contextualisation to India — why this experiment is necessary here, now, and what specifically about India’s urbanisation, governance constraints, climate risks, or labour markets makes Anantha relevant. Harder framing and some India-specific data would significantly strengthen the case.   and what can make it better or more convincing to a goverment person or investor

**ai**: To evaluate how well `Beginning.md` and `Why India.md` address point 2 of the feedback regarding the need for sharper India-specific grounding, and to suggest improvements for government officials or investors, I need to see the content of those notes.

Please provide the text from `Beginning.md` and `Why India.md`.
