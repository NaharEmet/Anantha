**user**: what is the difference betwen [[Beginning]] and [[Beginning 1]] 
[Context: Notes: Beginning.md, Beginning 1.md]
[Timestamp: 2026/01/29 20:05:41]

**ai**: The main differences between [[Beginning]] and [[Beginning 1]] are:

1.  **Git Merge Conflict Markers**:
    *   [[Beginning]] contains Git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> origin/main`) within the "Design Principles" section, specifically around the principle "**Nature is infrastructure**". This indicates an unresolved merge conflict in that note.
    *   [[Beginning 1]] does not have these conflict markers; the "Nature is infrastructure" principle is presented as a single, resolved line.

2.  **Internal Obsidian Links**:
    *   [[Beginning]] includes three internal Obsidian links:
        *   `[[The city as a system]]` (before "## Core Philosophy")
        *   `[[Defining Wealth]]` (after the "Redefining Wealth" section)
        *   `[[Governance Framework]]` (after the "Good Governance through systems" section)
    *   [[Beginning 1]] does not contain these three internal links.

Aside from these points, the textual content of both notes is identical.
