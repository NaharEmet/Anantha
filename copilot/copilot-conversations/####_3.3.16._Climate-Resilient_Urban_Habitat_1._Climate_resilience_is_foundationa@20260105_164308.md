**user**: #### 3.3.16. Climate-Resilient Urban Habitat

1. Climate resilience is foundational to Anantha’s design. The city anticipates and adapts to climate risks through:
    - Nature-based solutions
    - Distributed energy and water systems
    - Flood-resilient landscapes
    - Heat-mitigating urban form
    - Adaptive governance supported by real-time data

Rather than resisting change, Anantha evolves continuously in response to environmental and social feedback. #### 3.3.11. Walkable, Green Urban Habitat

1. Anantha prioritises pedestrians over vehicles. Compact neighbourhoods, shaded streets, cycling networks, green corridors, and mixed-use development ensure that daily needs are accessible within walking distance.
2. Green infrastructure performs multiple functions—cooling the city, managing stormwater, enhancing biodiversity, and improving public health.

#### 3.3.12. Steward for regenerative forest

Anantha priorities degraded land and focuses on creating regenerative forest, where the urban habitat becomes steward of regenerative forest and ensures that there is a symbiotic relation between the development and environment, habitat and forest.
 these 2 need to be integrated into [[Home]] both as a extract into the spine and as a seperate page give me the section for the spine and the page

## Climate-Resilient and Green Urban Habitat

Anantha is designed with climate resilience as a foundational principle, integrating nature-based solutions, distributed energy and water systems, flood-resilient landscapes, and heat-mitigating urban forms. Adaptive governance, supported by real-time data, allows the city to evolve continuously in response to environmental and social feedback, rather than resisting change.

The urban form prioritises pedestrians, fostering compact neighbourhoods with shaded streets, extensive cycling networks, and vibrant green corridors. Mixed-use development ensures that daily needs are met within walking distance, promoting a healthy and active lifestyle. Green infrastructure is not merely aesthetic but performs critical functions: cooling the urban environment, managing stormwater effectively, enhancing biodiversity, and significantly improving public health.

A core tenet of Anantha's development is its role as a **Steward for Regenerative Forest**. The city actively prioritises degraded land for the creation of regenerative forests. This approach ensures a symbiotic relationship between urban development and the surrounding environment, where the habitat itself becomes an integral part of the forest's stewardship and ensures a balanced coexistence between development and nature.
