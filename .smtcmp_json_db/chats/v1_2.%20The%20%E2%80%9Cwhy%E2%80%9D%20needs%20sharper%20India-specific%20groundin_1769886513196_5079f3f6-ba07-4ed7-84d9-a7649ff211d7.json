The “why” needs sharper India-specific grounding    \n6|The “why” is present but feels broad and generic. It would benefit a lot from deeper contextualisation to India — why this experiment is necessary here, now, and what specifically about India’s urbanisation, governance constraints, climate risks, or labour markets makes Anantha relevant. Harder framing and some India-specific data would significantly strengthen the case.  \n7|  \n8|3. Philosophy-heavy, but not yet outcome-driven    \n9|There is a lot of thoughtful philosophy, but very little articulation of clearly defined outcomes or KPIs. If this is a testable experiment, it needs a scorecard.    \n10|This includes:  \n11|- Human-level metrics: well-being, time-use, creative output, collaboration, etc. (even if measured via surveys or proxies)    \n12|- System-level metrics: energy use, biodiversity impact, local employment, food sovereignty, governance efficiency    \n13|  \n14|Right now, “wealth” is defined conceptually, but not operationally.\n```\n```Rajanya feedback.md\n28|6.
