Here is a mapping of your questions to the existing logic:\n\n### how do i see the machine llm human future \nYour framework for AI-human interaction is detailed in the Governance Framework. It specifies that AI agents handle context, history, and proposal generation, while humans are restricted to approving or rejecting these outputs rather than manual design.\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Main/Governance/Governance Framework.md\" language=\"markdown\" startLine=\"40\" endLine=\"61\"></smtcmp_block>\n\n### what do i care about and why\nThis is addressed through your \"Core Premise\" and \"Core Design Principles.\" You prioritize systems that don't rely on individual morality or intelligence, focusing instead on structural constraints, separation of ownership, and non-capture of the system.\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Main/Governance/Governance Framework.md\" language=\"markdown\" startLine=\"11\" endLine=\"19\"></smtcmp_block>\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Main/Governance/Ownership & Structural Architecture.md\" language=\"markdown\" startLine=\"28\" endLine=\"43\"></smtcmp_block>\n\n### oslo interactions with governments\nThe strategy for dealing with external political and regulatory environments is defined as \"Jurisdictional Risk Containment.\" You separate capital and IP (held in Singapore) from execution and political risks in the building sites.\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Main/Governance/Ownership & Structural Architecture.md\" language=\"markdown\" startLine=\"39\" endLine=\"41\"></smtcmp_block>\n\n### where do we build and why \nWhile the specific \"10 places\" list isn't fully expanded in these snippets, you have established a comprehensive baseline for urban projects using Bengaluru as the primary reference point for economic, demographic, and ecological metrics.\n\n<smtcmp_block filename=\"Main/execution/Metrics/KPI references.md\" language=\"markdown\" startLine=\"1\" endLine=\"27\"></smtcmp_block>\n\n### sequencing and timeline / how many people per project\nThere is currently no specific data in the provided snippets regarding headcount per project or the specific sequencing timeline. These sections in `oslo.md` appear to be new requirements or areas that need further expansion based on the existing `Post-Urban Performance Framework`.",
