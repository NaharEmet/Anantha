The first step is to clarify communication, establish common ground, and determine if there is truly a disagreement. If there is, the next step is to go through a process where both parties clarify what they believe and why. If the disagreement cannot be synthesized into a greater understanding and agreement, then elders with experience of similar situations will be brought in to resolve the issue.\n\nSmall unresolved conflicts can compound into systemic instability.\n\n#### Anantha OS introduces:\n\n- Guided dispute resolution via personal agents\n- Transparent reasoning trails for decisions\n\nThe goal is not to centralize authority, but to **reduce friction early** and preserve trust continuously.\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n</diff>\n</apply_diff>",
