The task mentions \"@Main\" and shows a folder structure with Governance/, Society/, Wealth/, and execution/ folders under Main. The environment details show they're currently viewing oslo.md in the Eutopia vault, with the current mode being \"Ask\" mode.\n\nLooking at this, it seems the user is likely indicating they want to work within the Main folder structure. Since I'm in Ask mode, my role is to help them explore and understand their knowledge base. I should analyze what they have in the Main folder to understand the current state of their vault organization and be ready to assist with any questions they might have about their knowledge base.\n\nI should",
