These could potentially contain project-related information.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided specific content about the project they're asking about, I need to ask for clarification. I should ask them to provide more details about which project they're referring to and what specific aspects they'd like me to evaluate.\n\nI'll use the ask_followup_question tool to request this clarification.\n</thinking>\n\n<ask_followup_question>\n<question>Could you please provide more details about the project you're referring to? Specifically, I'd like to know:\n1. Which specific project you'd like me to evaluate\n2. What aspects of the project you're most interested in (e.g., structure, content, organization, potential improvements)\n3. Any particular concerns or areas you'd like me to focus on\n\nThis will help me provide you with a more targeted and useful evaluation.</question>\n</ask_followup_question>",
