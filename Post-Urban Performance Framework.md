## A 21st-Century KPI System for Human, Economic, and Ecological Outcomes

## Purpose

Traditional urban KPIs optimize for GDP, density, and throughput — often at the expense of human well-being, resilience, and ecological health.  
This framework defines **measurable performance indicators** for a new class of settlements designed to maximize **human flourishing, innovation, and regenerative impact**, benchmarked against a Bangalore-equivalent urban baseline.

## North Star Outcomes (What Success Looks Like)

### 1. Human Flourishing

Measured via validated surveys and healthcare proxies.

- **50% reduction** in reported stress and depression
    
- **30% reduction** in hospital visits per capita
    
- **30% reduction** in sick days vs Bangalore workforce
    
- Increased overall well-being (life satisfaction, autonomy, social trust)

### 2. Economic & Creative Output

Measured via innovation and collaboration proxies.

- **30% increase** in company-level innovation output  
    _(new products, IP, ventures launched, revenue from new lines)_
    
- Increased creative output per capita
    
- Higher collaboration density across teams and organizations

### 3. Ecological Regeneration

Measured via land use and biodiversity indicators.

- **30% of total land** allocated to regenerative forestry
    
- Restoration of native ecosystems and species
    
- Net-positive ecosystem services (soil health, water retention, biodiversity)

## System Design Metrics (How Outcomes Are Achieved)

### Mobility & Time Use

- **70% reduction** in average daily travel time
    
- **100% elimination** of day-to-day car and bike transport
    
- **70% reduction** in transport-related energy consumption
    
- 2 hours reclaimed per person per day
    

---

### Food & Health Systems

- **≥50% of food produced locally**
    
- Improved nutritional quality and food sovereignty
    
- Shift from reactive to preventive healthcare utilization
    

---

### Energy & Resources

- 30% Reduced per-capita energy use vs urban baseline
    
- 50% local renewable energy
    
- 90% of grey and black water treated and used

## Governance & Resilience Metrics

- **Governance efficiency**
    
    - Faster decision cycles
        
    - High participation rates
        
    - Short conflict-resolution timelines
        
- **Local employment**
    
    - Majority employment within the community
        
    - High skills and role diversity
        
- **Food sovereignty**
    
    - Local control over calories, seeds, and inputs

## Measurement Approach (Lightweight but Credible)

- **Well-being:** WHO-5 / PHQ-9 surveys + anonymized health data
    
- **Innovation:** patents, new products, venture creation, peer benchmarks
    
- **Mobility:** time-use surveys and transport energy logs
    
- **Ecology:** indicator species counts, canopy cover, soil carbon

## Why This Matters

This framework replaces abstract growth metrics with **outcome-driven performance indicators** that reflect how people actually live, work, and thrive — while remaining economically productive and ecologically restorative.
