# A 21st-Century KPI System for Human, Economic, and Ecological Outcomes

## Purpose

Traditional urban KPIs optimize for GDP, density, and throughput — often at the expense of human well-being, resilience, and ecological health.  
This framework defines **measurable performance indicators** for a new class of settlements designed to maximize **human flourishing, innovation, and regenerative impact**, benchmarked against a Bangalore-equivalent urban baseline.

*All targets represent intended performance benchmarks for a pilot-scale settlement and are subject to validation through measurement.*

*Baseline values refer to metropolitan Bangalore averages for comparable working-age populations, using publicly available urban datasets and standard surveys.*

## North Star Outcomes (What Success Looks Like)

*Metrics are evaluated over a multi-year horizon (3–5 years), unless otherwise specified.*
