# A 21st-Century KPI System for Human, Economic, and Ecological Outcomes

## Purpose

Traditional urban KPIs optimize for GDP, density, and throughput — often at the expense of human well-being, resilience, and ecological health.  
This framework defines **measurable performance indicators** for a new class of settlements designed to maximize **human flourishing, innovation, and regenerative impact**, benchmarked against a Bangalore-equivalent urban baseline.

*All targets represent intended performance benchmarks for a pilot-scale settlement and are subject to validation through measurement.*

*Baseline values refer to metropolitan Bangalore averages for comparable working-age populations, using publicly available urban datasets and standard surveys.*

## North Star Outcomes (What Success Looks Like)

*Metrics are evaluated over a multi-year horizon (3–5 years), unless otherwise specified.*

### 1. Human Flourishing

Measured via validated surveys and healthcare proxies.

- **50% reduction** in reported stress and depression
- **30% reduction** in hospital visits per capita  
- **30% reduction** in sick days vs Bangalore workforce  
- Increased overall well-being (life satisfaction, autonomy, social trust)

---

### 2. Economic & Creative Output

Measured via innovation and collaboration proxies.

- **30% increase** in company-level innovation output  
  _(new products, IP, ventures launched, revenue from new lines)_  
- Increased creative output per capita  
- Higher collaboration density across teams and organizations

---

### 3. Ecological Regeneration

Measured via land use and biodiversity indicators.

- **30% of total land** allocated to regenerative forestry  
- Restoration of native ecosystems and species  
- Net-positive ecosystem services (soil health, water retention, biodiversity)

---

## System Design Metrics (How Outcomes Are Achieved)

### Mobility & Time Use

- **70% reduction** in average daily travel time  
- **100% elimination of day-to-day private motorized transport**  
- **70% reduction** in transport-related energy consumption  
- ~2 hours reclaimed per person per day

---

### Food & Health Systems

- **≥50% of food produced locally**  
- Improved nutritional quality and food sovereignty  
- Shift from reactive to preventive healthcare utilization
- reduced stress on health workers

---

### Energy & Resources

- **30% reduction** in per-capita energy use vs urban baseline  
- **50%** local renewable energy  
- **90%** of grey and black water treated and used for agriculture

---

## Governance & Resilience Metrics

### Governance Efficiency
- Routine decisions resolved within **2 weeks**  
- No decision cycle exceeding **6 months**  
- **≥60%** participation in governance processes  
- **≥50%** of conflicts resolved within **1 month**

### Local Employment
- All employment within the community or remote  
- High skills and role diversity

### Food Sovereignty
- Local control over calories, seeds, and inputs

---

## Measurement Approach (Lightweight but Credible)

- **Well-being:** WHO-5 / PHQ-9 surveys + anonymized health data  
- **Innovation:** patents, new products, venture creation, peer benchmarks  
- **Mobility:** time-use surveys and transport energy logs  
- **Ecology:** indicator species counts, canopy cover, soil carbon  

*Most indicators are measured annually, with select infrastructure and mobility metrics tracked quarterly.*

## Why This Matters

This framework replaces abstract growth metrics with **outcome-driven performance indicators** that reflect how people actually live, work, and thrive — while remaining economically productive and ecologically restorative.
