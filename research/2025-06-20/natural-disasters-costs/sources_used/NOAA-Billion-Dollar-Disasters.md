# NOAA Billion-Dollar Disasters 1980-2024

## Overview
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has tracked weather and climate disasters causing at least $1 billion in damages in the United States since 1980, providing one of the most comprehensive datasets on climate-related economic impacts.

## Key Statistics (1980-2024)
- Total confirmed weather/climate disaster events: 403
- Total direct costs: More than $2.9 trillion
- Total fatalities: Nearly 17,000 lives lost

## Disaster Type Breakdown
- Drought/heat wave events: 32
- Flooding events: 45
- Freeze events: 9
- Severe storm events: 203
- Tropical cyclone events: 67
- Wildfire events: 23
- Winter storms/cold waves: 24

## Temporal Trends
### Increasing Frequency
- Average time between billion-dollar disasters fell from:
  - 82 days during the 1980s
  - To 19 days during the last 10 years (2015-2024)

### Increasing Costs
- Average losses from billion-dollar disasters: $140 billion per year over the last decade (2015-2024)
- NOAA began tracking in 1980 when the U.S. experienced approximately three billion-dollar disasters per year
- From 2020 to 2024, the frequency has increased significantly

## Methodology
NOAA uses standardized criteria for identifying billion-dollar disasters:
1. Adjusted for inflation to 2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) values
2. Based on direct economic impacts (not including secondary effects)
3. Includes both public and private sector losses

## Regional Distribution
The database includes state-level summaries showing how different regions of the country have been affected by billion-dollar disasters over the 44-year period.

## Scientific Integrity
The dataset has been subject to scientific review and is considered one of the most reliable sources for tracking climate-related economic impacts in the United States.
