## Methodology and Criteria

### Billion-Dollar Disaster Criteria
1. **Minimum threshold**: $1 billion in damages
2. **Adjustment for inflation**: All values adjusted to 2024 dollars using Consumer Price Index
3. **Event definition**: Single, related event or series of connected events
4. **Damage types**: Includes direct damages, indirect costs, and secondary effects

### Data Sources
- National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)
- National Weather Service (NWS)
- Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
- Insurance industry data
- State emergency management agencies

### Event Classification
- Meteorological classification based on primary cause
- Geographic coverage based on affected areas
- Duration based on event timeline
- Severity based on damage metrics

## Scientific Integrity and Quality Control

### Data Quality Assurance
- Rigorous verification process for each event
- Multiple independent sources confirm damages
- Peer review by scientific experts
- Regular updates and corrections as new information becomes available

### Transparency
- Publicly available methodology
- Access to raw data
- Documentation of changes and updates
- Clear explanation of limitations

### Limitations
- Underreporting of smaller disasters
- Challenges in attributing specific economic impacts
- Difficulty in capturing secondary and tertiary effects
- Regional differences in reporting capacity

## Climate Change Context

### Observed Trends
- Increasing frequency of extreme weather events
- Higher intensity of certain disaster types
- Longer duration of some events (e.g., droughts, heatwaves)
- More rapid intensification of tropical cyclones

### Attribution Challenges
- While climate change is clearly increasing disaster risks, specific attribution to individual events remains complex
- Multiple factors contribute to observed trends, including:
  - Climate change impacts
  - Population growth in vulnerable areas
  - Increased development in disaster-prone regions
  - Improved reporting and assessment capabilities

### Future Projections
- Continued increase in frequency and severity
- Higher economic costs projected
- Changing geographic patterns of risk
- Growing protection gaps for certain disaster types
