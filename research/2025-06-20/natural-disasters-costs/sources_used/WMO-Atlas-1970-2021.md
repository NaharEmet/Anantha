# Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water-related Hazards (1970-2021)

## Overview
This Atlas is the most comprehensive assessment of mortality and economic losses from weather, climate and water-related hazards to date. It presents analysis of the impact of these hazards over a 50-year period from 1970 to 2021.

## Key Findings

### Mortality Statistics
- Over 2 million deaths from weather, climate and water-related hazards from 1970-2021

### Economic Losses
- Total economic losses amounting to US$ 4.3 trillion from 1970-2021
- Nearly 12,000 reported disasters during this period

### Distribution of Impacts
- Weather, climate and water hazards accounted for:
  - 50% of all disasters
  - 45% of all reported deaths
  - 74% of all reported economic losses from 1970-2019

## Methodology
The Atlas provides standardized analysis of disaster impacts across five decades, allowing for trend analysis and identification of patterns in both mortality and economic losses.

## Regional Analysis
The Atlas includes detailed analysis of regional differences in disaster impacts, showing how different parts of the world have been affected differently by weather, climate and water-related hazards over the 50-year period.

## Temporal Trends
The data shows clear temporal trends in both the frequency of disasters and their economic impact, with increases observed in both metrics over the time period.
