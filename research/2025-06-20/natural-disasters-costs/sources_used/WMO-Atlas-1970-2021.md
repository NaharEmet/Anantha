# WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water-related Hazards (1970-2021)

## Overview
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Atlas provides the most comprehensive assessment of mortality and economic losses from weather, climate and water-related hazards over a 51-year period from 1970 to 2021.

## Key Global Statistics (1970-2021)

### Human Impact
- **Total deaths**: Over 2 million people
- **Average annual deaths**: Approximately 40,000 people per year
- **Most deadly disasters**: Tropical cyclones and floods
- **Most deadly region**: Asia (91% of total deaths)

### Economic Impact
- **Total economic losses**: US$ 4.3 trillion
- **Average annual economic losses**: Approximately US$ 84 billion per year
- **Weather-related disasters**: Accounted for 74% of all reported economic losses globally
- **Losses growing exponentially**: Recent years show significantly higher costs than earlier decades

## Disaster Type Distribution (1970-2019)

### By Mortality
- Storms (including tropical cyclones): 59% of deaths
- Floods: 31% of deaths
- Droughts: 8% of deaths
- Wildfires: 1% of deaths
- Extreme temperatures: 1% of deaths

### By Economic Losses
- Weather-related disasters: 74% of all reported economic losses
- Hydrological disasters: 6% of all reported economic losses
- Climatological disasters: 20% of all reported economic losses

## Temporal Trends

### Accelerating Frequency
- **1970s**: Approximately 100 major disasters per decade
- **1980s**: Approximately 350 major disasters per decade
- **1990s**: Approximately 1,000 major disasters per decade
- **2000s**: Approximately 3,000 major disasters per decade
- **2010s**: Approximately 3,000 major disasters per decade

### Economic Growth
- **1970-1999**: US$ 1.45 trillion in economic losses
- **2000-2021**: US$ 2.85 trillion in economic losses
- Recent decade (2010-2019): Higher economic losses than all previous decades combined

## Regional Distribution

### Mortality Distribution
- **Asia**: 91% of total deaths
- **Africa**: 5% of total deaths
- **Americas**: 2% of total deaths
- **Europe**: 1% of total deaths
- **Oceania**: <1% of total deaths

### Economic Loss Distribution
- **Americas**: 41% of total economic losses
- **Asia**: 33% of total economic losses
- **Europe**: 15% of total economic losses
- **Africa**: 8% of total economic losses
- **Oceania**: 3% of total economic losses

## Key Findings on Climate Change Impact

1. **Weather-related disasters dominate**: 74% of economic losses from 1970-2019 were weather-related
2. **Increasing frequency and intensity**: Clear evidence of rising disaster frequency over time
3. **Disproportionate impact on developing countries**: Higher mortality rates despite lower absolute economic costs
4. **Growing economic burden**: Economic losses are growing faster than global GDP growth
5. **Prevention saves lives**: Early warning systems have reduced mortality in recent years

## Methodology and Limitations

### Data Collection
- Based on disaster databases maintained by WMO Members
- Includes both reported and estimated data where necessary
- Uses standardized metrics for consistent comparison across time and regions

### Limitations
- Historical data completeness varies significantly
- Economic loss methodologies have evolved over time
- Some developing countries have limited reporting capacity
- Categorization systems have changed over the five-decade period

## Climate Change Context

The Atlas explicitly links observed trends to climate change, noting that:
- Human-induced climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of many weather-related disasters
- Rising global temperatures are contributing to more extreme precipitation events
- Sea level rise is amplifying coastal flooding impacts
- Changing weather patterns are disrupting historical norms for disaster frequency and seasonality
