# Munich Re Natural Disaster Figures 2024

## Overview
Munich Re's 2024 natural disaster analysis reveals a significant increase in global catastrophe losses compared to previous years, with climate change impacts becoming increasingly evident across multiple regions and disaster types.

## Global Loss Summary (2024)

### Total Economic Losses
- **Global natural disaster losses in 2024**: US$ 320 billion
- **Previous year comparison**: Considerably higher than 2023 (US$ 250 billion, adjusted for inflation)
- **Previous year comparison**: Higher than 2023 (US$ 268 billion, adjusted for inflation)
- **Insured losses**: US$ 140 billion
- **Previous year insured losses**: US$ 106 billion

### Year-over-Year Increase
- **Total economic losses increase**: 28% increase from 2023 to 2024
- **Insured losses increase**: 32% increase from 2023 to 2024
- **Above average performance**: Both total and insured losses were considerably higher than recent averages

## Regional Distribution

### Asia-Pacific and Africa
- First half of 2024: Responsible for total losses of US$ 40 billion
- Insurance gap: Only US$ 9 billion of those losses were insured
- Both total losses and insured losses were above average values
- Significant protection gap in these regions

### Americas
- Major disaster events affecting both North and South America
- Tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic and Pacific
- Severe weather events contributing to overall losses
- Mixed levels of insurance coverage by region

### Europe
- Various weather-related events throughout the year
- Flood events in certain regions
- Winter storm activity
- Generally higher insurance penetration compared to other regions

## Disaster Type Analysis

### Severe Thunderstorms
- Record thunderstorm losses in 2024
- Particularly severe in North America
- Contributed significantly to insured losses
- Increasing trend in frequency and severity

### Flood Events
- Major flooding in multiple regions
- Climate change contributing to increased flood risk
- High economic impact but often lower insurance coverage
- Growing protection gap for flood risks

### Tropical Cyclones
- Active hurricane season in multiple basins
- Landfall events causing significant economic damage
- Varying intensity and impact by region
- Traditional patterns showing some modifications

### Climate-related Extremes
- Heatwaves affecting multiple continents
- Drought conditions in various regions
- Wildfire activity in certain areas
- All showing increasing trends linked to climate change

## Climate Change Context

### Climate Change Showing Its Claws
Munich Re explicitly states: "Climate change showed its claws in 2024"

### Key Climate Change Indicators
- Increasing frequency of extreme weather events
- Higher intensity of certain disaster types
- Changing seasonal patterns and geographic distribution
- More rapid intensification of tropical cyclones
- Increased precipitation intensity in many regions

## Insurance Market Implications

### Protection Gap Analysis
- Significant portion of total losses remain uninsured globally
- Regional variations in insurance penetration
- Developing economies generally have lower coverage levels
- Climate change exacerbating existing protection gaps

### Reinsurance Market Impact
- 2024 results show significant impact on reinsurance market
- Pricing adjustments likely based on loss experience
- Increased focus on climate-related risks
- Growing demand for innovative risk transfer solutions

## Methodology and Data Sources

### Global Data Collection
- Comprehensive global disaster tracking
- Standardized methodology for consistent comparison
- Inflation adjustment where appropriate
- Both insured and uninsured loss tracking

### Event Classification and Analysis
- Meteorological categorization
- Geographic distribution mapping
- Severity assessment based on financial impact
- Trend analysis across multiple time periods

## Economic Impact Assessment

### Direct Economic Damages
- Property destruction and damage
- Agricultural losses
- Infrastructure damage
- Business interruption losses

### Indirect Economic Effects
- Supply chain disruptions
- Economic multiplier effects
- Government response and recovery costs
- Long-term reconstruction and adaptation costs

### Regional Economic Impact Variations
- Higher absolute losses in developed economies
- Higher relative impact (as percentage of GDP) in developing economies
- Varying levels of insurance protection
- Different recovery capacities and economic resilience

## Trend Analysis

### Long-term Trends
- Clear upward trend in both frequency and severity
- Climate change identified as key driver
- Increasing economic losses despite improved risk management
- Growing protection gap in certain regions and for certain peril types

### Recent Acceleration
- 2024 shows acceleration in both frequency and economic impact
- Particularly severe for certain disaster types
- Climate change impacts becoming more evident
- Insurance market responding to changing risk profile
