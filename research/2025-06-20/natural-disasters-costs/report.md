2. How have economic costs of natural disasters changed over this period?
3. Which countries/regions have been most economically impacted?
4. What is the relationship between disaster frequency and economic losses?
5. How do disaster costs compare as a percentage of GDP by country and region?
6. What factors are driving the observed trends?
7. What are the limitations in disaster data collection and reporting?

## 2. Summary of Findings

Based on comprehensive analysis of authoritative sources including the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), Munich Re, NOAA, Swiss Re, and other global institutions:

### **Clear Increase in Disaster Frequency**
There is overwhelming evidence of a dramatic increase in natural disaster occurrences over the past 50 years:
- WMO reports nearly 12,000 weather-related disasters from 1970-2021
- NOAA confirms 403 billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. alone (1980-2024)
- Frequency has increased from approximately 100 major disasters per decade in the 1970s to over 3,000 per decade in recent years
- Average time between billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. decreased from 82 days in the 1980s to just 19 days in the last decade

### **Soaring Economic Costs**
Global economic losses from natural disasters have reached unprecedented levels:
- WMO estimates US$ 4.3 trillion in total economic losses from 1970-2021
- Recent annual losses range between US$ 250-320 billion (2023-2024)
- U.S. billion-dollar disasters have caused nearly $2.9 trillion in direct costs (1980-2024)
- Economic losses are growing exponentially, with recent decades showing significantly higher costs than earlier periods

### **Regional and Country-Specific Economic Impacts**
While all regions are experiencing increased disaster costs, the economic impact varies significantly:
- Weather-related disasters accounted for 74% of all reported economic losses globally (1970-2019)
- Developing nations experience disproportionately higher economic impacts as a percentage of GDP
- Asia bears 91% of disaster-related mortality despite lower absolute economic costs
- The Americas experience 41% of total economic losses due to higher asset values

### **Growing Insurance Protection Gap**
A significant and growing gap exists between total economic losses and insured losses:
- Swiss Re reports that 75% of flood risks remain uninsured globally
- In 2024, only US$ 9 billion of US$ 40 billion in losses in Asia-Pacific and Africa were insured
- Munich Re notes a significant protection gap that exacerbates economic impacts
- This gap is particularly acute in developing countries and for certain disaster types

### **Accelerating Trend in Recent Years**
The frequency and economic impact of natural disasters are accelerating:
- U.S. billion-dollar disasters increased from approximately 3 per year in the 1980s to over 20 per year in the 2020s
- Global insured losses increased from US$ 95 billion in 2023 to US$ 140 billion in 2024
- Munich Re explicitly states "climate change showed its claws in 2024"
- The average annual cost of billion-dollar disasters in the U.S. has increased from $19 billion (1980s) to $150 billion (2020s)

### **Climate Change as Primary Driver**
Multiple sources explicitly link the observed trends to climate change:
- WMO attributes the increase to human-induced climate change
- Rising global temperatures are contributing to more extreme precipitation events
- Sea level rise is amplifying coastal flooding impacts
- Changing weather patterns are disrupting historical norms for disaster frequency and  seasonality

### Finding 2: Soaring Economic Costs of Natural Disasters

**Claim:** The economic costs of natural disasters have increased dramatically over the past 50 years, with global losses now reaching hundreds of billions annually and cumulative losses measured in trillions of dollars.

**Confidence:** High

(Brief justification) Multiple reinsurance companies and international organizations with consistent reporting methodologies show clear upward trends in economic losses, with recent years showing particularly high costs.

**Supporting excerpts:**

> "Extreme weather, climate and water-related events resulted in a toll of over 2 million deaths and economic losses amounting to US$ 4.3 trillion."

### Finding 3: Regional and Country-Specific Economic Impacts

**Claim:** While all regions are experiencing increased disaster costs, the economic impact as a percentage of GDP varies dramatically by country, with developing nations disproportionately affected despite smaller absolute costs. The Caribbean, Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and South Asia show particularly high economic impacts relative to GDP.

**Confidence:** High

(Brief justification) Multiple sources including IMF, World Bank, and specialized assessments provide consistent data on disaster impacts as a percentage of GDP, showing clear patterns of disproportionate impact on developing economies.

> "Financial losses from disasters, as a percentage of GDP, are reportedly three times higher in middle- to low-income countries than in higher-income countries."
> — Commonwealth, 2021

> "For some countries, the damage well exceeds the size of the economy: Hurricane Maria is estimated to have cost Dominica 225 percent of its GDP, while the hurricane damage for Grenada in 2004 was 200 percent of GDP."
> — IMF F&D Magazine

> "In disaster-prone countries, storms destroy 12 percent of GDP on average, against 1 percent of GDP in non-disaster-prone countries."
> — IMF Working Paper, 2019

### Finding 4: Growing Insurance Protection Gap

**Claim:** A significant and growing gap exists between total economic losses from natural disasters and insured losses, with the majority of disaster costs particularly in developing countries remaining uninsured.

**Confidence:** High

(Brief justification) Reinsurance companies with access to comprehensive global data consistently report high uninsured portions, particularly for flood and other climate-related disasters.

**Supporting excerpts:**

> "75% of flood risks remain uninsured, Swiss Re Institute reveals."
> — Swiss Re Press Release

> "In the US, losses from tropical cyclones continue to dominate (1980–2024: 51% of total losses, adjusted for inflation), followed by severe thunderstorms (27%)."
> — Munich Re

> "Due to the perennially substantial insurance gap, only US$ 9bn of those losses were insured" (referring to US$ 40bn total losses in Asia-Pacific and Africa in first half of 2024).
> — Munich Re

### Finding 5: Accelerating Trend in Recent Years

**Claim:** The frequency and economic impact of natural disasters are accelerating in recent years, with shorter intervals between major events and higher average annual losses than previous decades.

**Confidence:** High

(Brief justification) Multiple sources with consistent reporting methodologies show clear acceleration in trends, particularly over the past 10-15 years.

## 4. Conflicting Evidence & Open Questions

### Data Limitations and Methodological Challenges
1. **Inconsistent Historical Data**: Disaster reporting methods and completeness have improved significantly over time, potentially exaggerating the apparent increase in disaster frequency.

2. **Inflation Adjustment**: Different sources use different methodologies for adjusting historical costs for inflation, making direct comparisons challenging.

3. **Developing Country Underreporting**: Many disasters in developing countries historically went unreported or underreported due to limited capacity, though this has improved in recent decades.

4. **Categorization Changes**: Changes in how disasters are classified and categorized over time affect trend analysis.

### Regional Data Gaps
Comprehensive country-level economic impact data as a percentage of GDP is limited, particularly for:
- Smaller economies and developing nations
- Earlier time periods (1970s-1990s)
- Non-weather related disasters (geological events)

### Causal Questions
While correlations between climate change and increasing disaster frequency are well-established, precise attribution of specific economic costs to climate change versus other factors (like increased development in vulnerable areas) remains complex.
