## Preliminary Findings

### Disaster Frequency Trends
- Clear upward trend in natural disaster frequency over the past 50 years
- WMO reports nearly 12,000 weather-related disasters from 1970-2021
- U.S. billion-dollar disasters increased from approximately 3 per year in 1980 to more frequent events
- Average time between billion-dollar disasters in U.S. decreased from 82 days (1980s) to 19 days (2015-2024)

### Economic Cost Trends
- Global economic losses from natural disasters: US$ 4.3 trillion (1970-2021)
- Recent annual losses: US$ 250-320 billion (2023-2024)
- U.S. specific: $2.9 trillion in direct costs from 403 billion-dollar disasters (1980-2024)
- Economic losses as percentage of GDP showing increasing trend, particularly in vulnerable countries

### Regional Patterns
- Weather-related disasters accounted for 74% of all reported economic losses globally
- Climate change is making events more intense or more frequent
- Insurance gap remains significant, particularly for flood risks (75% uninsured)

## Data Gaps and Limitations
- Inconsistent reporting methodologies across countries
- Historical data quality varies significantly
- Inflation adjustment methodologies differ between sources
- Developing countries may have underreporting due to capacity limitations
